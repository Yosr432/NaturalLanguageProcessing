The company said in an announcement  our desktop app is simply an extension of your phone,  with all messages synced between devices. WhatsApp s success in countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa is of course driven by the high penetration of smartphones in those markets, but giving power users including people who rely on WhatsApp for work communications desktop options helps it competes against other messaging services, like iMessenger, WeChat, and Skype. WhatsApp is currently testing out B2C accounts, which would give it a new revenue source after dropping its 99 cent annual subscription fee.
