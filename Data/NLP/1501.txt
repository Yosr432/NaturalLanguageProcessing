The CEO of the company behind Ashley Madison is resigning: The chief executive of the parent company of Ashley Madison, a dating site targeting people looking for extra-marital affairs, resigned Friday after a massive hack exposed the personal information of millions of its users. Earlier this month, personal information about millions of Ashley Madison customers, including e-mails, member profiles, credit-card transactions and other sensitive information, showed up online. A group known as Impact Team took credit for the hack, which is now under investigation by the FBI and Canadian authorities.The information was initially only accessible on the dark Web, where users must use anonymous browsing tools. But soon after the hack, databases showed up on the broader Web allowing people to search some parts of the data. Analysis of that data seemed to suggest that most of the female profiles on the site were fake. Those millions of Ashley Madison men were paying to hook up with women who appeared to have created profiles and then simply disappeared. Were they cobbled together by bots and bored admins, or just user debris  Whatever the answer, the more I examined those 5.5 million female profiles, the more obvious it became that none of them had ever talked to men on the site, or even used the site at all after creating a profile. Actually, scratch that. As I ll explain below, there s a good chance that about 12,000 of the profiles out of millions belonged to actual, real women who were active users of Ashley Madison. When you look at the evidence, it s hard to deny that the overwhelming majority of men using Ashley Madison weren t having affairs. They were paying for a fantasy.
