The Gannett-Tribune offer: No one knows what a newspaper is worth anymore:  Three years ago, Jeff Bezos paid $250 million for the Washington Post from the Graham family. Last year, Japanese publisher Nikkei paid $1.3 billion to take the Financial Times off the hands of the education conglomerate Pearson. Today s $815 million bid to buy Tribune Publishing, from USA Today owner and newspaper chain Gannett, basically falls in the middle of those two recent deals. And it suggests that as print revenue continues to decline, there s no such thing as a market price for newspapers anymore. Gannett is offering $12.25 a share (5.6 times Ebitda*), or a 63 percent premium on the current value of its stock, to buy the struggling newspaper publisher, which owns eleven dailies, including the Chicago Tribune and crown jewel Los Angeles Times. In 2013, Bezos paid what analyst Ken Doctor called a  friendship premium  of 17 times Ebitda; when Nikkei bought the FT, the going rate for European newspapers was 12 times Ebitda. Nikkei paid 35 times Ebitda. This isn t a friendly offer, meaning Tribune might not play ball, but investors sure seem to dig it. Tribune Publishing s stock opened the day by rocketing up more than 50 percent. Wall Street probably likes it because of Tribune s dwindling print business, which justifies the lower Ebitda on the Gannett offer.
