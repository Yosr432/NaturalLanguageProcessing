NYT VR: How to Experience a New Form of Storytelling From The Times: Today, The New York Times takes a step into virtual reality. NYT VR is a mobile app that can be used   along with your headphones and optionally a cardboard viewing device   to simulate richly immersive scenes from across the globe. To start, The Times Magazine presents three portraits of children driven from their homes by war and persecution   an 11-year-old boy from eastern Ukraine named Oleg, a 12-year-old Syrian girl named Hana and a 9-year-old South Sudanese boy named Chuol.  This new filmmaking technology enables an uncanny feeling of connection with people whose lives are far from our own,  writes Jake Silverstein, editor of the magazine.
