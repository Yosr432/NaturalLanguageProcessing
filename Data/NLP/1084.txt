Universities Race to Nurture Start-Up Founders of the Future:  Ten years ago, it may have sufficed to offer a few entrepreneurship courses, workshops and clubs. But undergraduates, driven by a sullen job market and inspired by billion-dollar success narratives from Silicon Valley, now expect universities to teach them how to convert their ideas into business or nonprofit ventures. As a result, colleges   and elite institutions in particular   have become engaged in an innovation arms race. Harvard opened an Innovation Lab in 2011 that has helped start more than 75 companies. Last year, New York University founded a campus entrepreneurs  lab, and this year Northwestern University opened a student start-up center, the Garage.

In an engineering department design lab, teams of students in the university s global health technologies program were working on assignments to develop products for real clients   many of them for hospitals in Malawi, in southeastern Africa, seeking low-cost medical devices.
