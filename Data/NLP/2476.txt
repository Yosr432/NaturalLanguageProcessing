A Korean urban logistics startup that aims to be "Uber for last-mile deliveries" is in the news and gaining traction: Seoul-based urban logistics startup Naldo is gaining some serious momentum in its home country. The company, which works sort of like an Uber for last-mile deliveries, now boasts over 500 corporate customers, tripling its client base in the last year. "We all buy more stuff online, but we are not aware that more online purchasing requires more offline delivery. That s why this is an overseen goldrush for us," Ebner-Chung says. Among its clients are steel giant Posco, social commerce site Coupang, and investment bank Kyobo Securities. Naldo founder and CEO Ludolf Ebner-Chung says the company saw revenues grow 1,000 percent in 2014, with consistent double-digit growth every month since launching two years ago. Naldo works similar to other logistics-on-demand startups, like Gogovan and Easyvan in Hong Kong. With its mostly two-wheeled fleet, it promises delivery within 90 minutes in Seoul. The site connects clients directly to available nearby drivers with no middlemen involved. Next, Ebner-Chung says the startup will soon launch a native app and an open API, which has already been tested by popular ecommerce sites like Ticketmonster, WeMakePrice, and Ridibooks. He says this will be of significant value to online SMEs as it gives them delivery options to gain an edge on their competition. It also reduces dependency on the old call center-based logistics companies. Chung says South Korea s B2B real-time delivery market is worth US$5 billion.
