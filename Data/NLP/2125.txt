Spotify Said to Seek Financing to Value Music Site at $8 Billion: Spotify Ltd. is in the process of raising new financing that would value the largest subscription music-streaming service at about $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. That valuation is double what the company was worth when it raised money in November 2013. The latest round totals about $400 million, according to one of the individuals, and comes from a group that includes Goldman Sachs Group and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Spotify continues to raise money as it tries to build a global subscription music service before Apple Inc. or Google Inc., which are both pursuing the same market. Spotify has more than 60 million users, a quarter of whom pay $9.99 for a monthly, ad-free version. Like Pandora Media Inc., a public company valued at $3.55 billion, Spotify pays a large percentage of its revenue to record labels and publishers for the right to license their music. With sales of both CDs and digital downloads in decline, the three major record labels -- Vivendi SA s Universal Music Group, Sony Corp. s Sony Music Entertainment and Access Industries  Warner Music Group -- view streaming as the key to future growth. Though the labels own a stake in Spotify, they have complained about the money they receive from the company and pushed for greater restrictions to its free service. Spotify has resisted those overtures, arguing that an appealing free service is the best way to lure customers who will then subscribe. Listeners must have a subscription to access the full offering on a mobile phone.
