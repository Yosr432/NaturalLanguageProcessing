Home Depot Aiming to Put Apple Pay in Its 2,000 Stores: Home Depot Inc. has the goal of offering Apple Inc. s mobile-payment platform at its more than 2,000 stores, which would make it the largest retailer yet to accept Apple Pay. Customers already were able to use Apple Pay at some of Home Depot s stores despite there not being an agreement. The world s largest home-improvement retailer could accept mobile payments at those locations because its checkout terminals have near-field communication readers. Those devices have now been turned off for the past few weeks during an upgrade of its point-of-sale system, Holmes said. That led to some inaccurate reports that Home Depot had dropped Apple Pay. If it pushes ahead with the plan, Home Depot would join chains like Macy s Inc. and Whole Foods Market Inc. in embracing Apple Pay at stores. Many other retailers are betting on a mobile-payment option from the Merchant Customer Exchange, which was founded in 2012 by companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. That offering, CurrentC, is still being developed.
