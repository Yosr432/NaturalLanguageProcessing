Facebook will tweak your news feed based on how long you look at stuff: Facebook is tweaking its algorithms to account for a new metric: the amount of time you spend looking at things in your feed, regardless of whether or not you actively interact with it. Scroll past something without stopping for long, and Facebook s algorithms will slowly learn that you don t particularly care for that sort of content. Camp out on a post for a bit, though, and Facebook starts the timer behind the scenes. If you spend more time on this story than you spend on most things in your feed   studying a picture, perusing the comment thread   they ll take that as a signal that it s something you care about. Facebook is doing this because it realizes that you probably don t always like, share or comment on the stuff that pops up in your Facebook feed, even if it s something you care to see. In other words: those endless baby photos and motivational fitness memes that you tend to scroll right on past  At least theoretically, this change allows Facebook s algorithms to take the hint without requiring you to lift a finger.
