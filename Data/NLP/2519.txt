Amazon takes 1.3 days on average to return cash, the quickest among online stores, and customers respond, according to new research from StellaService Inc., which tracks e-commerce data. While most Web stores will only pay once a return parcel is on its way, Amazon offers instant refunds for some purchases, issuing immediate credit and 30 days to return a product. Instead of tying up cash and preventing customers from buying other things, Amazon s aim is to get people spending again. That s especially critical during and after the annual holiday shopping season, when gift returns spike and consumers are predisposed to buy merchandise. Fast refunds are also important in Internet commerce because shoppers buy things they haven t touched or tried, making return rates higher than in retail outlets.  Amazon is killing it on refunds and others should follow suit,  said Eduardo Vilar, chief executive officer of Returnly Technologies Inc., a San Francisco company that researches retail returns.  Customers who are given the right experience on a return are more loyal shoppers.  Amazon s instant refund, which was rolled out quietly last year, gave the Web retailer the fastest refund-processing time out of 40 companies measured by StellaService. Amazon s closest competitors in refund-processing speed include online furniture and home goods retailer Wayfair Inc. (W) and personal computer and printer-maker Hewlett-Packard Co., which both took about three days to issue refunds, according to StellaService. The average refund-processing time of the 40 companies tracked by the researcher was more than nine days.
