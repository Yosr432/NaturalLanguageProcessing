Morgan Stanley Said Struggling to Sell EBay Enterprise Deal Loan: Morgan Stanley is struggling to unload $640 million of loans backing the private-equity buyout of EBay Inc. s enterprise business after investors shunned the debt, according to people with knowledge of the deal. The bank has been trying to sell the loans since mid-October and continues to hold the debt even after EBay said on Nov. 2 that the sale was completed. Morgan Stanley has discussed a steeper discount to lure buyers and has been probing investors in recent days about the price at which they may be willing to buy the debt, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. One concern investors have raised is that the company s projected earnings may be too optimistic. Buyout targets often make adjustments to forecast earnings, called add-backs, that can reduce a borrower s leverage.
