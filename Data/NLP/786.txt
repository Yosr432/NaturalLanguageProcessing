Apple's Push to Flood India With Used iPhones Ignites Backlash: Apple Inc. s latest attempt to crack the Indian smartphone market -- by selling used phones -- is meeting a wall of resistance. The iPhone maker is seeking permission to become the first company allowed to import and sell used phones into the country, its second attempt in as many years. This time, the stakes are higher and a growing number of industry executives are fighting the move, warning government officials in private that it ll open the floodgates to electronic waste, jeopardize local players, and make a farce of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Make in India program to encourage local manufacturing.  Make in India could turn into Dump in India,  said Sudhir Hasija, chairman of Karbonn Mobiles, who said it sells about 1.7 million phones a month. Apple s application in 2015 was rejected by the environment ministry without much fanfare. But things have changed since: India, as the world s second largest mobile population, now represents a vast untapped opportunity for Apple just as China and the U.S. are slowing. Apple has publicly talked up its prospects in India and is on course to get the green light to open its first retail stores. Apple now has less than 2 percent of an Indian market in which four-fifths of phones cost less than $150. Branded smartphones are available for as little as $35 in India. Western multinationals from car-makers to soda vendors use  India only  prices and cut-rate  India edition  products to woo customers. Apple can t employ those strategies without tarnishing its marquee phone s premium aura.
