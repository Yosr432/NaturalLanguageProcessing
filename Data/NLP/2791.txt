Smart notifications based on location targeting worked spectacularly well for American Eagle: American Eagle Outfitters   an early adopter of beacon technology   used push notifications delivered through the Shopkick app to successfully draw more customers into fitting rooms this summer. For nearly two months the retailer sent a push notifications to select customers as they entered the 100 of the company s 929 stores that are outfitted with beacons. The message offered 25 kicks   Shopkick s rewards currency   if they tried something on in a fitting room. American Eagle found that customers that received the offer were more than twice as likely to try on clothing as those who didn t.  That s incredible. It s way beyond anything I anticipated,  said Joe Megibow, chief digital officer at American Eagle Outfitters.  American Eagle Outfitters placed a beacon at the front entrance and in the fitting room of each trial store. When a customer with the Shopkick app entered the store, the beacon sensed their smartphone s presence via Bluetooth, and triggered Shopkick to display a message offering 25 extra kicks. The beacon in the fitting room determined if the same customer had approached it, and awarded the 25 extra kicks. More than 10,000 customers took part in the trial.
