Google Is Acquiring Rich Messaging Startup Jibe Mobile: Google said on Wednesday that it has acquired Jibe Mobile, a messaging startup that specialized in helping carriers build support for native video messaging into their services. The effort, designed to make video chat as ubiquitous and interoperable as text messages, is known as Rich Communications Services, or RCS. Google said it is making the purchase as part of a commitment to supporting RCS as part of its messaging strategy.  SMS carrier messaging is used by billions of people every day and enables people to reach anyone around the world, regardless of their device, carrier, app or location,  Android engineer and  minister of messaging  Mike Dodd said in a blog post.  However, the features available in SMS haven t kept up with modern messaging apps. Rich Communications Services (RCS) is a new standard for carrier messaging and brings many of the features that people now expect from mobile messaging, such as group chats, high res photos and more.  Financial terms were not disclosed.
