WeWork Is Cutting About 7% of Staff: WeWork, the world s largest shared-workspace startup, plans to cut about 7 percent of its staff and has instituted a temporary pause on hiring, according to e-mails obtained by Bloomberg. The cutbacks come just three months after the New York company said it raised a round of $430 million led by Chinese investors. Managers were instructed to begin dismissals this week, said one of the e-mails. The startup, which lets members rent desks in an open office, ballooned from about 230 employees early last year to more than 1,000 today, according to research firm Mattermark. WeWork said it hired 175 people in May and expects to add about 500 employees by the end of the year. The company said it expects to lift the pause on hiring as soon as next week. The funding round in March valued WeWork at $16 billion with a focus on financing expansion throughout Asia, people familiar with the matter said at the time. WeWork's valuation is more than those of major landlords such as SL Green Realty Corp., which has a market value of $10.6 billion. Boston Properties Inc., the largest U.S. publicly traded office landlord, is valued at $19.6 billion.
