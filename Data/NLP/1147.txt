Can t Put Down Your Device  That s by Design: Digital life keeps us hooked with an infinite entertainment stream as its default setting. Tech companies often set it up that way. There s Facebook beckoning with its bottomless news feed. There s Netflix autoplaying the next episode in a TV series 10 seconds after the previous one ends. There s Tinder encouraging us to keep swiping in search of the next potential paramour. And then there are the constant notices and reminders   a friend liked your photo or tweet; a colleague wants to connect with you on LinkedIn; an Evite awaits your response   which automatically induce feelings of social obligation. You damn yourself to distraction if you respond, and to fear of missing out if you don t. Tech companies tend to present these feedback loops as consumer conveniences. A new Intel TV ad, for instance, shows a young girl in the back of a car growing sad because the laptop on which she was watching a singalong video suddenly runs out of power. The company s new battery-preserving processor, though, ultimately saves the day,  so you never have to stop watching.  T-Mobile has just introduced BingeOn, a feature that offers subscribers on certain plans unlimited high-speed access to popular streaming video channels. There s even an industry term for the experts who continually test and tweak apps and sites to better hook consumers, keep them coming back and persuade them to stay longer: growth hackers.
