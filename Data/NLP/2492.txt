Alibaba-owned mobile browser UC Browser teams up with Facebook in India: Late yesterday, Chinese tech company UC Web announced that Indian users of its mobile UC Browser will be getting a special surprise: real-time Facebook notifications as they browse the web. Prior to this, Facebook has not offered real-time notifications outside of its own mobile apps, so this partnership is   according to UC Web   breaking new ground. Users interested in taking advantage of the new feature won t have to do much: simply download the latest update for the browser, log into your Facebook account, and you should begin enjoying instant Facebook notifications right in the browser, no matter what page you re on. This isn t the first time UC has pushed to make its app more appealing to Facebook users, though. In June of last year, the company released a Facebook plugin for the app that speeds up Facebook s loading time for users who choose to browse it within UC Browser. UC Browser is one of the most internationally successful tech products to emerge from China in recent years. UC Web recently announced that its browser is the most popular third-party mobile browser in the world. It even ranks above first-party browsers like Chrome and Safari in key Asian markets including China and India.
