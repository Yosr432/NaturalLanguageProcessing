Amazon Raises Minimum Order Size as It Seeks More Prime Buyers: Amazon.com Inc. is increasing the minimum order size for free shipping to $49 from $35, a step that could encourage more consumers to sign up for Prime, the online retailer s annual service that includes two-day deliveries. The benefit of getting more people to sign up for Prime services -- for $99 a year -- is that they tend to shop more frequently and spend more money, while access to other perks such as online movies, music and other content helps to keep customers within Amazon s shopping ecosystem. By encouraging non-Prime customers to spend more on a single order, Seattle-based Amazon is also aiming to reduce costs while boosting profits on each sale. The new threshold follows a 33 percent jump in fulfillment costs -- warehousing, packaging and shipping -- in the fourth quarter, which outpaced a 15 percent increase in product sales. Monday s price increase is the first since 2013, when Amazon raised the threshold to $35 from $25. Amazon s new minimum order size for free shipping brings it in line with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. s online store, which has a threshold of $50, or free pickup in stores. Target Corp. has a $25 minimum, while it s $35 at startup Jet.com Inc.
