Hands-On With Google s New Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X Smartphones: Google announced its newest pair of Android smartphones, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. This is the first time since the Nexus line was launched, in 2010, that Google is releasing two phones at once. Each is targeted at a different segment of the market, but they both share a number of critical features for wooing customers. The 6P is Google s new flagship, the successor to last year s Nexus 6. The original Nexus 6 was made by Motorola (owned by Google at the time, though since bought by Lenovo) and was met with mixed reactions from critics and customers. It was big, the camera wasn t as good as those in competing phones, and it was roughly twice the price of its own predecessor, the Nexus 5. The 6P is the first Nexus phone made by Chinese company Huawei, and it tries to fix what was wrong with the 6 while bringing a few new things to the party. The smaller Nexus 5X, manufactured by LG, is just over five inches long and has an ultrasensitive camera that is designed to work better indoors, where people take most of their pictures. It starts at $379 for an entry-level phone without a contract. The other larger phone, the Nexus 6P, which is made by Huawei, is 5.7 inches and starts at $499. Both phones use a new kind of charging cable, called USB Type-C, that powers up more quickly and has a symmetrical charging port so people won t have to fumble to figure out which way to plug it in. Nexus runs what Google calls the  purest  form of its Android operating system. The devices come with a few Google apps but are otherwise free of so-called bloatware   software loaded onto a device by a phone maker   that can slow the device. Also, Nexus products receive monthly security updates and come with the latest version of Android, making them a kind of showcase for new Google products.
