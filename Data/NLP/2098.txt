Rakuten Ventures invests in push notification platform startup: Rakuten Ventures, the investment arm of the Japan-based ecommerce titan, announced today that it has made an undisclosed seed investment in a US startup that s made a push notification platform aimed at mobile app and game developers. That startup is OneSignal, which today rebrands from GameThrive.  If the opportunity arises, Rakuten Ventures would love to see the [OneSignal] team partner up with Rakuten Group to utilize the company s capabilities,  he adds. Viber, which Rakuten acquired in February 2014, has 236 million monthly active users at the last count, surpassing the much-hyped Line app. While most people are coming to hate spammy push notifications as much as banner ads, they re still considered by many mobile app developers as a great tool for engagement   to give people a little nudge and some kind of enticement to get back into their app or game. The simple fact is that monetization is a lot harder if people don t open your app all that often.  Push notifications are a key part of every single mobile application since they are easy to use, have low barriers for user opt-in, and have significantly higher visibility than email messages,  explains George Deglin, the CEO of OneSignal.  Most of our clients use our service to send occasional messages to their users to re-engage users by encouraging them to complete an action or to tell them about new features. We also have many clients using our service for transactional notifications, such as telling users when it s their turn in a multiplayer game.  The team has recently been working on HTML5 push notification support in Google Chrome and Firefox.  With this, our developer audience will soon expand outside of mobile to include anyone with a website,  adds Deglin.
