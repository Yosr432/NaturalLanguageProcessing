Amazon calls 2016 holiday season its best ever; shares rise: Amazon.com Inc said it shipped more than 1 billion items worldwide this holiday season, which the top online retailer called its best ever, and its shares rose 1.6 percent in afternoon trade. The Amazon Echo home assistant and its smaller version, Echo Dot, topped the best-sellers list, said Jeff Wilke, chief executive of Amazon's worldwide consumer division, in a press release. Sales of voice-controlled Echo devices were nine times more than they were during last year's holiday season, the company said. Amazon likely sold between 4 million and 5 million devices this year to date with Alexa, the voice-controlled assistant on the Echo, estimated Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy in a research note. Shoppers can command the Echo to perform a host of tasks, from playing music to turning on Christmas lights. More than 72 percent of Amazon's customers worldwide shopped through mobile devices, the company added, and Dec. 19 was the busiest shopping day this holiday season. Other best sellers on Amazon included 72-pack Keurig K-Cups, the movie "Finding Dory," Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Gear VR virtual reality headset and Nintendo Co Ltd's Pok mon Sun and Pok mon Moon role-playing video games, the company said.
