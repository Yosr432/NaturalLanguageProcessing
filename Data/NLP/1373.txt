What it s like to ride in a Google self-driving car: Google s cars have been trained to be extremely conservative in unusual situations.  They understand their own limitations,  said Dmitri Dolgov, principle engineer on Google s self-driving car project, at a briefing later.  They understand that there s something really crazy going on and they might not be able to make really good, confident predictions about the future. So they take a very conservative approach.  A few blocks away from Google I got another glimpse of the SUV s cautious nature. A car, also with a stop sign, arrived at the intersection just after us. The Google car inched forward in two spurts. After a pause we drove through the intersection. We got through it fine, but slower than I expect most drivers would have. Soon we pull back in front of GoogleX s building, a 14-minute ride in the books.  Manual,  calls out the female voice as our driver took control again, and turned the car off. If I was grading the SUV on our brief trek I would give it a B+. It wasn t perfect driving, but safe and effective. Of course, our route wasn t especially difficult. The real challenges come when pedestrians, inclement weather, construction sites and cyclists arrive.
