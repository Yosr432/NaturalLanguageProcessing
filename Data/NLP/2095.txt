AMD Q2 earnings: Stock Drops 10%, Most Since July After Outlook Misses Estimates: Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell the most since July after the chipmaker s revenue forecast fell short of analysts  estimates. Second-quarter revenue will be between $968.2 million to $1.03 billion, the Sunnyvale, California-based company forecast Thursday in a statement after markets closed. Analysts had predicted $1.14 billion, according to 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. AMD shares slid 10 percent to close at $2.58 on Friday as the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.5 percent amid a broad decline for stocks. AMD is trying to break away from more than 40 years as a cheaper alternative to Intel Corp., the world s largest chipmaker. Sales from custom chips that AMD sells for video-game consoles such as Sony Corp. s PlayStation and Microsoft Corp. s Xbox haven t made up for falling demand for personal-computer processors.
