China stocks are 8% down this morning; Alibaba stock is at its lifetime low: China's securities regulator said there was "panic sentiment" in mainland stock markets on Wednesday, acknowledging the recent increase in irrational selling, Reuters reported. Shortly after, the People's Bank of China said it will closely watch stock market direction and guard against systematic regional financial risks. The comments did little to soothe investor worries about tumbling mainland equities, with the Shanghai Composite sinking more than 8 percent in early trade on Wednesday. In US trading, Alibaba was traded at its lifetime low.
