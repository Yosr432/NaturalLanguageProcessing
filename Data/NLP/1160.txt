Startup Founders Sound Just as Pessimistic About a Bubble as Tech Journalists: There has been a lot of kvetching of late about whether or not we re in the middle of another tech bubble, and most of the pontificating has come from venture capitalists and tech media. But what do people who launch startups actually think  According to First Round Capital s new State of Startups Report   a survey of more than 500 founders of VC-backed companies   founders are also largely convinced we re in a tech bubble of some sort. First Round s findings indicate that startup leaders are having a harder time raising money and that they think it s only going to get tougher. The report also says they believe bitcoin is one really overhyped technology, whereas self-driving cars don t get enough attention. We ve embedded the report in a slideshow below, but here are some key facts and figures from First Round: 80 percent of founders say they were able to raise what they wanted to in their last rounds, but virtually all of them say that it will be harder to do so in the next year. 73 percent of startup founders believe we are in a bubble, but enterprise startup leaders are twice as likely to say we aren t (twice as many enterprise tech founders also say they ll be profitable in the next year). No one has a clue about what the IPO market will look like in 2016: One third says there will be more IPOs, one third says it ll be about the same and one third says there will be fewer. 90 percent of founders expect to see more tech mergers and acquisitions over the next year, which is also what s generally expected by industry analysts and experts.
