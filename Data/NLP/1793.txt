Now you can use Facebook Messenger without Facebook: Are you one of the 1.44 billion people who use Facebook  Then this post isn't for you. The company made an announcement Wednesday for those other folks -- the Facebook holdouts who are probably tired of being pestered by their friends to give in and sign up already. Now they can talk to their friends on Facebook without having to open account, via Messenger. The option is limited, for now, to people in the United States, Canada, Peru and Venezuela. But non-Facebook users in those countries can use all of the Messenger features, including group and multimedia messaging, by simply signing up for a Messenger account. "With this update, more people can enjoy all the features that are available on Messenger   including photos, videos, group chats, voice and video calling, stickers and more," the company said in an official blog post. "All you need is a phone number."Communication, generally, has become a bigger focus for Facebook, which is attempting to to build a family of social apps that extends beyond its core social network. Giving Messenger a larger potential install base is an easy way for Facebook to continue that spread, although its growth shouldn't worry WhatsApp users. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has made clear that he has no plans to merge the two services any time soon.
