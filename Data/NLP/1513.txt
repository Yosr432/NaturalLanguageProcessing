Facebook Goes Nuclear On The Messaging War With Its M Assistant: All messaging apps are the same no more. A few years ago, there were few differences between SMS and a slew of chat apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Kik, Line, KakaoTalk and Facebook Messenger. But each have slowly defined themselves differently, whether through simplicity, connections to businesses, media, stickers, games, location, and other features. But today, Facebook escalated the battle for chat with the official announcement of M, its new personal assistant built into Messenger. It can actually complete tasks for you, such as buy things, deliver gifts, make reservations, arrange travel, or just about anything else you ask of it. What s truly unique, though, is what s behind M. Specifically, a lot of live bodies. M isn t just artificial intelligence. Facebook has contracted real people to help M answer people s requests while teaching the technology how to handle them automatically in the future. M is still in early beta testing, so it s hard to assess just how well it accomplishes this grand ambition. But if it works, Facebook may have developed a product so useful yet so complex and resource-intensive that it could differentiate Facebook Messenger in a way its competitors can t or won t follow. There are digital assistants like Google Now and Siri. But those are so mechanized that they can only provide rote answers and reminders. There are personal assistants like Magic and Operator that use humans to answer complex requests, but they re independent apps without massive scale. And there are messaging apps fighting to grow their already-huge audiences, but that still look similar despite their attempts to differentiate.
