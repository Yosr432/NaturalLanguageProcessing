Amazon and YouTube get ready to rumble over online video:  Amazon is moving into the space long held by YouTube, announcing on Tuesday thelaunch of a new platform that allows anyone to post original content. Called "Amazon Video Direct," the site offers creators a way to make money in a variety of ways, including royalties on videos streamed by paying Amazon Prime members, revenue shares for videos rented or purchased, ad impressions for free-to-watch videos, and any combination of these models. The new platform places Amazon in direct competition with Google's YouTube, the firm leader in the video upload space that counts 1 billion users. YouTube has its own revenue sharing model for its top creators. Starting in 2007, it launched its Partners Program, which gave popular content creators a cut of the ad revenue earned from views to their pages. But there has been controversy in connection with the cut that YouTube takes, which is 45% of the revenue, and the site does not offer to cover any video creation costs, leading some YouTube creators to speak out about comparatively unfair profits. Amazon has not yet detailed what percentage of revenue creators will get with the Video Direct service. But it is offering a pay-to-subscribe option direct to each individual channel, similar to Twitch, which allows users to  follow  specific content creators for a fee. The owner of the channel would make a percentage of the profit from those subscriptions. Amazon will also pay out $1 million as a bonus among the creators of the top 100 videos viewed by Prime members each month.
