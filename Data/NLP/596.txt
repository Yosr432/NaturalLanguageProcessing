Thiel-Gawker Fight Raises Concerns About Press Freedom: The story of Gawker versus Hulk Hogan   or, perhaps more accurately, Peter Thiel   has some asking whether press freedom in the United States is in peril if a scorned billionaire can help deliver a crippling blow to a media company. But since Mr. Thiel spoke to The New York Times on Wednesday about his reasons for funding the lawsuit against Gawker, the debate surrounding the dispute has expanded to encompass ideological battles in media, technology and politics. A variety of observers, including other billionaires and figures involved in GamerGate, have entered into the fray to address themes like Mr. Thiel s political motivations, and the wider issue of Silicon Valley power players and their involvement with the news media. Several journalists felt that Mr. Thiel s political views and connection withDonald J. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, could be worrisome based on Mr. Trump s previous comments about changing libel laws to make it easier to sue media outlets.
