Microsoft profit up as demand for cloud service soars: Microsoft Corp reported a 3.6 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by growth in its fast-growing cloud computing business, but it saw a slight decline in margins in the unit that includes its flagship cloud platform Azure. Shares of the world's biggest software company were up about 1.1 percent in after-hours trading. Microsoft Corp reported a 3.6 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by growth in its fast-growing cloud computing business, but it saw a slight decline in margins in the unit that includes its flagship cloud platform Azure. Sales in Microsoft's personal computing business, which includes its Windows software, once the bedrock of the company, fell 5.0 percent to $11.8 billion, slightly beating the rate at which personal computer sales fell in the quarter. Along with his push into cloud and mobile, Nadella also orchestrated Microsoft's biggest acquisition, the $26.2 billion deal for LinkedIn, which closed last month. LinkedIn contributed $228 million of revenue in the quarter, Microsoft said, but reported a net loss of $100 million, or one cent per share. The company's net income rose to $5.20 billion and adjusted revenue, excluding LinkedIn, was $25.838 billion, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $25.298 billion. Microsoft's shares had risen 23.2 percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 20.7 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 index.
