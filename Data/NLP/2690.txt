Cable & Wireless, which was bought by Vodafone in 2012, provided British spies with traffic from rival foreign communications companies, Britain's Channel 4 television said, citing documents stolen by Edward Snowden. Channel 4 said Cable & Wireless gave Britain's GCHQ eavesdropping agency access by renting space on one of the arteries of global communications, a cable that runs to the southern English region of Cornwall. The Channel 4 report, which was impossible to immediately verify given the secrecy of the surveillance programs, said Cable & Wireless carried out surveillance on Internet traffic through its networks on behalf of British spies.
