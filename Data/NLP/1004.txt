Apple TV And Apple Watch (Probably) Had A Big Quarter:  Apple s  other  category makes it difficult to assess how many Apple Watches and TVs were purchased. What we do know is that the $4.35 billion in the  other  category saw a big jump   not just 62 percent annually, but up 43 percent since the last quarter. This means that there was a spike in sales months after the initial Apple Watch release in April. This could be because of increased holiday sales or a popular fourth generation Apple TV. Beats headphones and iPods are also included in   other.  Without giving specific sales numbers, CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that it was the  best quarter by far for Apple TV sales.  There are 3,600 apps available for the TV now, he said.  Cook added that the company  set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales especially strong sales in the month of December.  Apple has never released specific Watch sales numbers. Asymco analyst Horace Dediu updated his Apple Watch projections "My estimate on Watch sales is about 5.5 million units during Q4. 12.4 million to date"
