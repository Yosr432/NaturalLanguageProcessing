Twitter CEO Search Gains Urgency as Stock Slips, Executives Exits: Pressure on Twitter s board is mounting. In the three months since the company started searching for a new chief executive officer, the stock has slipped 22 percent and several product executives have left. A leading internal candidate, according to people close to the board, is interim leader and co-founder Jack Dorsey -- who s already CEO at a company on the verge of an initial public offering. Twitter s board didn t have a succession plan in place when former CEO Dick Costolo departed, even though it wasn t a surprise exit. That means they re doing the search with the public knowing it s happening, opening themselves up to scrutiny about their every move, Pozner said.  The board needs to take some action and communicate it to shareholders,  she said.  There s a huge amount of uncertainty, which creates a really uncomfortable feeling for shareholders and internal stakeholders.  Twitter s share price has been lingering for the past month around the $26 price investors paid in its initial public offering in November 2013. Part of the selloff was triggered by Dorsey, who bluntly stated after the company s second-quarter earnings report in July that it will take a while before Twitter is able to reverse a slowdown in growth. He called its product performance  unacceptable.
