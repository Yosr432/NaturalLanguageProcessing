Beset With Failures, Google Tries to Breathe New Life Into Android One - Appoints Caesar Sengupta as New Leader. Caesar Sengupta, a VP based in Singapore who once managed Chromebook globally, now oversees Android One. He is close to Sunder Pichai and is admired within the company, largely for his work on Chromebooks.  If there s anyone at Google who understands the hardware partner ecosystem, it s Caesar,  said Shailesh Nalawadi, who left Google two years ago to co-found Mavin, a mobile startup focused on reducing Internet access costs in markets like India.  He s probably the best person to be working on this.  Last September, Google inaugurated Android One, a cheap smartphone line for emerging markets, with typical Google audacity: It was billed as the fix  for the next five billion  soon to come online. The initiative, which promised low-cost devices with the latest version of the Android operating system and Google s full software imprint, was a point of pride within Google. Started in India, one of Google s biggest markets and the birthplace of Android chief Sundar Pichai, it was counted among the many bids to spread Internet access globally. Android One began with a bang, thanks to the tremendous marketing dollars Google put behind it. But despite its scale, it has been a disappointment, beset by reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners, as well as misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware, according to multiple people familiar with the project.
