Amazon confirms international expansion of its Fresh grocery delivery service: Amazon announced an overseas expansion of its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service on Thursday, starting with a rollout in certain neighborhoods in London. Recode reported two weeks ago that Amazon planned to expand to a variety of new markets this year, including the U.K. and Boston in the U.S., after an 18-month hiatus on new city launches. The service will cost Londoners about $10 a month on top of their regular Amazon Prime membership, or about $120 a year. In the U.S., an Amazon Fresh membership costs about $200 on top of the normal $99 Prime membership program. Orders of around $58 or more come with free delivery in London. Amazon delivers the groceries   which can include both packaged groceries as well as perishable items like meat and cheese   on the same day for morning orders, or the next day for late afternoon and evening orders. Amazon Fresh launched nearly a decade ago, but has expanded slowly as the company has tried to figure out a business model that works. The service was previously only available in parts of Washington, California, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The online grocery market is still tiny in the U.S., but is more mature in the U.K. That means more competition for Amazon, but perhaps the opportunity to grow the business more quickly.
