Smart in-store notifications using location targeting beacons are gaining popularity among offline retailers: Urban Outfitters is loading up 15 stores in Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Atlanta, New Jersey and Delaware with beacons small devices that marketers place around stores that ping messages at shoppers who have downloaded the retailer's app. Swirl, the platform that powers the beacons, said that two-thirds of consumers shop in-store with a smartphone. And instead of pushing aggressive offers at smartphone-wielding consumers, the beacons plug into the Urban On loyalty program, a section in the app that gives shoppers rewards and access to events. Initially, Urban Outfitters has pinpointed three areas to focus its mobile efforts around: the checkout line, fitting rooms and the entrance. When smartphone-wielding shoppers first enter the store, a push notification prompts users to check-in via social media to unlock an offer. Then in the fitting room, beacons are being used to churn out user-generated content about products. Shoppers are prompted to take selfies and post them to Instagram with the hashtag #UOonYou for a chance to be featured on Urban Outfitters' website. Shoppers at the register may get a push notification promoting them to shake their phone to show the Urban ID a loyalty card and earn a digital badge.
