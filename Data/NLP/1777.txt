Intuit Lays Off 399 Employees In Company Realignment: Intuit has confirmed to TechCrunch that it has laid off 399 people, or just under 5 percent of the company s roughly 8,000 employees, in a re-alignment of the company. Patrick Barry has also stepped back from leading Demandforce, though he remains an employee of Intuit. In the past year, Intuit s stock has risen more than 28 percent, and the company is currently worth more than $28 billion based on its market cap. Intuit is best known for its tax preparation services like TurboTax and financial services like QuickBooks. In January the company partnered with Uber and Stripe to help those on-demand workers keep track of their finances. The tools help workers quickly figure out what their tax bills and write-offs will be for work-related expenses. In January, Intuit also bought ZeroPaper, a startup that offers online accounting services for small businesses, as it began to take an interest in Brazil. It also bought a payroll services startup Acrede in December this year.
