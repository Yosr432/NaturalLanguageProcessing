GoPro plunges on Apple patent win: GoPro shares plummeted 12 percent, their steepest decline since August, after Apple  was granted a patent for a remote-control camera system. The stock dropped to $49.87 at the close in New York. The plunge followed Apple gaining a patent today from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a system that lets consumers control a digital camera remotely. Investors are concerned that the patent will let Apple, the world s largest company by market valuation, make products that are similar to what GoPro offers, said Charlie Anderson, an analyst at Dougherty & Co. Apple sold more than 270 million units of its various products in fiscal 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. GoPro, which went public in June and is trading at more than twice its initial public offering price of $24 a share, has been volatile in recent months. The world s biggest maker of wearable cameras used by surfers and sports enthusiasts to record their exploits is facing questions about its ability to create a media business around the videos that consumers post online using their GoPro devices. About half of the company s outstanding shares will also become available on the market on Feb. 17 when a lock-up lifts on employees and other insiders  shares, Anderson said.
