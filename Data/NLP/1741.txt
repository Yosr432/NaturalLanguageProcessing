Tesla Rises After Second-Quarter Deliveries Top Forecast: Tesla Motors gained the most since April after the electric-car maker beat its car-sales forecast for the second consecutive quarter with a 52 percent surge in the three months through June. The shares rose 4 percent at the close in New York for the biggest daily advance since April 27. Tesla has climbed 26 percent this year, outpacing the Russell 1000 Index s 1.3 percent increase. Tesla delivered 11,507 Model S sedans in the second quarter, according to a statement of preliminary figures Thursday. The Palo Alto, California-based company predicted in May that it would sell 10,000 to 11,000 of the cars, its only model, during the period. The preliminary total brings first-half sales to 21,552, less than 40 percent of Tesla s full-year target of 55,000 vehicles. Output and deliveries are projected to increase with the introduction of the Model X sport utility vehicle this quarter.  Tesla still has to deliver on the Model X promise,  Dan Dolev, a Jefferies analyst, said in a telephone interview. With the Model S,  the execution is there, the demand is there, the delivery is there, so that all these areas are positive is encouraging.
