Facebook Takes a Step Into Education Software: Facebook, which transformed communication with its social networking service, now wants to make a similar impact on education. The Silicon Valley company announced on Thursday that it was working with a local charter school network, Summit Public Schools, to develop software that schools can use to help children learn at their own pace. The project has been championed by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook s co-founder and chief executive, and one of his top lieutenants, Chris Cox. The software allows students to work with teachers to create tailored lessons and projects. Teachers can also administer individualized quizzes that the software can grade and track. The platform, which is separate from the Facebook social network, is now being used by nine Summit schools and about 20 others. Ultimately, Ms. Tavenner said,  our motivation is to share it with everyone and anyone who wants it,  including other charters and public school districts. The software would be free for all users. Mike Sego, the Facebook engineering director running the Summit software project, said making money was not an immediate goal.  Whenever I ask Mark,  Do I need to think of this as business   he always pushes back and says,  That shouldn t be a priority right now. We should just continue making this better.
