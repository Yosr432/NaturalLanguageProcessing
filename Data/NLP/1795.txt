Gloves Off in China as Banks, Alibaba Invade Each Other s Turf: This week, Alibaba is launching MYbank, an online lender that will tap into Chinese savers  record $7.8 trillion of deposits and a banking revenue stream that s forecast to double by 2020. Banks have been striking back by pushing into the business Ma pioneered in China, online malls. The moves are blurring the lines between banking and e-commerce as China s government continues encouraging competition in the finance industry and as Chinese increasingly use computers and mobile phones to bank and shop.  China s banks have woken up and realized that the challenge from Alibaba s entry into banking is for real,  said David He, a Hong Kong-based partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group Inc.  For them, doing e-commerce is a defense as well as a counterattack.  Banking giant ICBC, which as the world s most profitable company dwarfs Alibaba s net income by more than 10 times, set up a platform allowing retailers to sell the bank s customers wine, shampoo, appliances and more. China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and others are also getting into the action. ICBC s site, called Easy to Buy, is forecasting sales of 300 billion yuan this year, after tallying 130 billion yuan so far since January. By comparison at Alibaba, its Tmall logged 763 billion yuan in sales last year. JD.com ranked second at 260 billion yuan.
