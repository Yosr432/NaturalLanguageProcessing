After acquisitions in Europe and New Zealand, Zomato now launched in Toronto: Just weeks after announcing its fourth acquisition in three months (in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and New Zealand), Indian restaurant search and discovery service Zomato took its first step into the North American market today. This time, instead of taking the buyout route, Zomato launched in Canada, listing over 11,000 restaurants in the Greater Toronto area on its website as well as mobile apps.
