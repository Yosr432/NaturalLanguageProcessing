Samsung is acknowledging lost ground to Apple in the high-end market, and will look to re-claim lost ground in China: Samsung has capitulated: It launched two phones last night, the Galaxy A3 and A5, which are both  mid-range  devices with metal bodies. They look a bit like iPhones, but they ll probably be priced cheaper. It s the price that is key: Samsung is basically saying it cannot compete against iPhone on high-end prices with top-flight models, so it must compete instead against cheaper low-end Android manufacturers like China s Xiaomi by offering quality devices at reasonable prices. The Galaxy A3 and A5 are seen by analysts as Samsung's first counter-strike. Initially launching in China in November, they will be Samsung's first devices to feature fully metallic bodies and its thinnest smartphones to date. In size, the A3 and A5 are comparable to those of the top-of-the-line Galaxy S5, though of lesser screen resolution quality. Meanwhile, Sony will retreat from the Chinese smartphone market, where it has had little success.
