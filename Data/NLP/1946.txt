Consolidation in China's online travel sector: Expedia gives up on China partner, sells off $671M majority stake in eLong: Ctrip, China s top travel site, this afternoon announced it has taken a US$400 million stake in long-time arch-rival eLong. The deal, which closed today, was done by acquiring eLong shares from Expedia. Ctrip now has a 37.6 percent stake in its erstwhile rival. Expedia has sold off its entire 62.4 percent stake in eLong, worth US$671 million, by selling the remaining shares to three other buyers (Keystone Lodging Holdings, Plateno Group, and Luxuriant Holdings), the US-based company said today. As a result of this deal, Ctrip says that it and Expedia have agreed to cooperate with each other on  certain travel product offerings for specified geographic markets.  Expedia s brief statement did not make clear why it s exiting eLong. The huge Expedia sell-off marks a major sea-change in China s highly competitive travel ecommerce sector. It seems to be a huge win for Ctrip, which has now tamed its closest competitor. That leaves Ctrip freer to focus on newer and fast-growing rivals such as Baidu-owned Qunar, Tuniu, and LY. Ctrip has US backing of its own in the form of Priceline, which owns about eight percent of the company.
