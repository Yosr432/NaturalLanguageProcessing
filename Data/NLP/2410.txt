Twitter out-performed Facebook during the Super Bowl, say some analysts:  Twitter appears to still be the place for live social media commentary, especially for brands that have to pay to get the most out of their Facebook activity. However, Facebook has made major efforts to capture the discussion, introducing trending topics (much like Twitter) and creating a Super Bowl hub for game chatter. Last night placed the two platforms head-to-head in a way that shows the benefits and drawbacks of both. In some areas, Twitter dominates, and Facebook controls others. Half the ads in the Super Bowl featured hashtags, while Facebook was mentioned four times. There were 265 million posts, comments and likes related to the Super Bowl on Facebook, the company said. Update: There were 36 million tweets related to the Super Bowl, up from about 25 million last year, and they recieved 2.5 billion impressions, according to Twitter.The conversation was most active on both platforms at the end of the game when New England sealed the victory with a last-second interception. Facebook said 1.36 million people per minute were discussing the Patriots' win by the end of the game. Twitter calculated 395,000 tweets per minute on the interception. Katy Perry's halftime show generated 3 million tweets. Meanwhile, Facebook said more than 1 million people per minute discussed the performance in real time.
