Amazon is circling Jabong; potential deal size ~$1-1.2B, two sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. According to a source, the meeting took place very recently and it has not even been a week. Restructuring would be complicated: Jabong is an inventory-based e-tailer, where foreign investment is not allowed at present. Another source cited above said that Amazon would keep Jabong as a separate property post the acquisition.  It (deal) would be very much on the lines of Amazon s acquisition of Zappos in the US,  he said. Jabong, which is one of the two top lifestyle e-tailers in the country along with Flipkart owned Myntra, reported gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs 509.5 crore from 3.197 million orders in the January-June 2014 period. This marked a three-fold rise over the previous year. If it maintains the same growth through the rest of the year it may end with GMV of around Rs 1,300-1,500 crore for the year ending March 31, 2015. Accepted fair valuation in e-com space internationally is pegged at 3.5x sales which would value Jabong at around Rs 5,000 crore. Jabong could be looking to drive a hard bargain given the strategic play of Amazon in India and significance of the deal to win in the high stakes game in the country.
