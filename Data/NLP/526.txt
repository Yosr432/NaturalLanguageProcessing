Tesla offers $2.8 billion for SolarCity in 'no brainer' deal for Musk: Tesla s stock drove off a cliff after the SolarCity bid was announced, and Elon Musk and his family could stand to gain $700 million in Tesla shares from SolarCity deal: Elon Musk on Tuesday sought to build a clean energy powerhouse as his electric car maker, Tesla Motors , made an offer to buy his solar installation firm SolarCity Corp in a stock deal worth as much as $2.8 billion. Tesla shares plunged more than 13 percent to $189.99 in extended trading - amounting to a loss in value of about $4.3 billion, or more than the value of the offer for the other company. Shares of SolarCity rose about 18 percent to $25.02. Musk, who is the chairman of SolarCity, CEO of Tesla and the largest shareholder of both companies, described the deal as a "no brainer" in a call with reporters. Tesla investors punished the company's shares, however.  Musk, who owns 19 percent of Tesla and 22 percent of SolarCity, said he would recuse himself from voting on the deal. He could not say how soon shareholders could vote on the deal, as due diligence needs to take place first. SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive, Musk's first cousin, said he supported the deal but would also recuse himself from voting. Rive's brother, Peter, is also a founder of the company and its chief technology officer.
