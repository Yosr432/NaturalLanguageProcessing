Trailing in the Cloud, Google Taps VMware Founder to Chase Amazon: With its cloud business, Google finds itself in a rare position: Behind. The search giant has toyed with different enterprise products for years, with limited success, and now faces fierce competition from Microsoft and Amazon. But Google is signaling that it is serious about building an enterprise business. And here is its biggest sign: Alphabet has tapped Diane Greene, a founder and former CEO of the software company VMware, to run it. Sundar Pichai, Google s CEO, announced the move in a blog post. Therein he said Greene, who has been a Google board member since 2012, will take over  all our cloud businesses, including Google for Work, Cloud Platform and Google Apps.  The move includes an acquisition of Greene s new company, Bebop. Pichai describes it as a  new development platform that makes it easy to build and maintain enterprise applications.  Google isn t sharing a price on the deal. Greene is joining at a moment when Google s cloud efforts, both on the application and the infrastructure side, seem to be spinning. Three years ago, the narrative about Google Apps was how it was so often displacing Microsoft Office with its word processing and spreadsheet apps that run in a browser. Now that Microsoft Office has gotten the cloud religion with Office 365, which runs both as an on-premise version and in the cloud, the narrative around Google Apps has shifted in the last year or so: It s now described generally as  doing well with small businesses,  even though Google itself still touts the fact that 60 percent of the Fortune 500 use it. Still, the cloud world has just gotten a lot more competitive. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced Office Graph, a set of unified APIs that will let third-party developers build add-ons and apps that enhance how Microsoft Office works. This hiring seems a partial response to that.
