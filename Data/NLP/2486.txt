Uber plans to introduce background check procedures for its drivers in India, the company said Thursday evening, in a move that comes weeks after a driver was charged with rape there. The episode prompted wider scrutiny of the ride-hailing service that is now banned in some parts of the country. The company started operating in the Delhi region of India in late 2013, but has not screened those drivers, according to local Uber executives. Previously, Uber accepted new drivers if they presented proof of insurance, a driver s license and a commercial permit to drive a taxi. That will soon change. Uber will run a series of more stringent checks on its drivers, which include a formal background check, verification of character by the local police and checks to detect fraud in driving and vehicle permits. Since the rape, Uber has pointed out the difficulty of screening drivers in hundreds of cities across the world, an argument that the company has also used in the United States to support its background check procedure.  This unfortunate incident has highlighted challenges in the systems due largely to nondigitized record-keeping and the lack of a centralized database for criminal offenders,  Ms. Delivala said.  To ensure verifications are legitimate and reliable, more needs to be done at the ground level.  In the United States, background checks for Uber are conducted by Hirease, a third-party service, which checks city, state and federal records. Lawmakers in many states, including California, Colorado and Illinois, have contested this approach, citing the more stringent checks required of taxi and limousine drivers.
