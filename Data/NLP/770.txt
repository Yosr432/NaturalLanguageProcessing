Yik Yak s CTO drops out as the hyped anonymous app stagnates: Is Yik Yak a thing anymore  Not so much, according to download stats, traffic charts, surveys and a source that says the college app s monthly user count has been declining. That source   with intimate knowledge of the company   also tipped me off that Yik Yak s original CTOTom Chernetsky has bailed, which the startup now confirms. He s not the only one who thinks the supposed rocket ship won t fly as high as some expected when Sequoia led a mammoth $62 million at $400 million valuation in November 2014. Since late last year, Yik Yak s VP of Product, Director of Engineering, Lead Product Designer and other senior employees have departed. Months after Sequoia pumped a ton of cash into the Atlanta startup, download rates and traffic began to drop, according to App Annie and comScore charts dug up by GigaOm. Things have gotten worse since, as Google Play dropped it from its charts last March, likely due to hate speech in the app. These stats all mesh with what my source says, which is that Yik Yak has had zero significant growth in over a year, and consistently misses its growth targets. They cite 4 million monthly active users as the count in January, noting the number has declined since then, though I can t confirm that exact number. The problem with anonymous apps is that over time they start to feel exhausting. The crude stories, played-out jokes stolen from Reddit and cringe-worthy bullying wear on people. While they might have a few juicy quips of their own to share, blowing off steam can eventually feel pointless. That s why my Secret and Yik Yak usage dried up. Yik Yak s product has continued to plod along, despite some colleges  attempts to ban the app for facilitating cyberbullying. But nothing has made it feel fresh again.
