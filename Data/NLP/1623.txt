Baidu Plans $1 Billion Buyback to Bolster Slipping Stock Price: Baidu, China s biggest Internet search engine company, said on Thursday it will buy back shares worth $1 billion after the company s stock price slid following a weak earnings report earlier this week. The repurchases will take place over the next 12 months and be funded from the company s existing cash balance, New York-listed Baidu said in a statement. Baidu shares have fallen 14 percent since July 27, when it reported lower-than-expected second-quarter profit. The company s plan to spend aggressively on connecting online smartphone users to offline services raised investor concerns on margins, triggering the shares  worst two-day drop since late 2008. Baidu said last month it would invest $3.2 billion in linking mobile internet users to nearby offline services such as buying cinema tickets, booking taxis, getting restaurant deals. But these O2O services are eroding the healthy margins Baidu enjoyed from its core search business.
