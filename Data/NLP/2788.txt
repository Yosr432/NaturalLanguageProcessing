More positive press for Pinterest - which rivals Facebook in some engagement metrics and is just starting to monetize: A visual social network where people create and share image collections of recipes, hairstyles, baby furniture and just about anything else on their phones or computers, Pinterest isn t yet five years old, but among women, who make up over 80% of its users, it s already more popular than Twitter, which has a market capitalization of more than $30 billion. Pinterest s U.S. user base is projected to top 40 million this year, putting it in a league with both Twitter and Instagram domestically, and it s moving fast to catch up with them overseas, opening offices in London, Paris, Berlin and Tokyo over the past year. International users now make up nearly half of new sign-ups, according to the research firm Semiocast. Pinterest even doubled the number of active male users in the past year. To date, Pinterest s users have created more than 750 million boards made up of more than 30 billion individual pins, with 54 million new ones added each day. During the 2013 holiday season Pinterest accounted for nearly a quarter of all social sharing activity. Among social networks, only Facebook, with its 1.3 billion users, drives more traffic to Web publishers. All that activity sounds big, but it understates the moneymaking opportunity in front of Pinterest, which will ultimately be judged by how much revenue it can wrest from its users. While it s the earliest of days still, many analysts and observers believe that, on the basis of average revenue per user, it s only a matter of time before Pinterest blows past Facebook, Twitter and the rest of the social pack.  They re going to bring in billions of dollars a year,  says Dave Weinberg, founder of the social marketing company Loop88.
