China's market regulator claims it will tighten eCommerce regulations: China s market regulator said today that the government will regulate ecommerce more strictly in an upcoming clampdown on counterfeit products and poor customer service. The comments came from Zhang Mao, minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), speaking on the sidelines of China s annual parliamentary session, according to state news agency Xinhua. The move comes weeks after the SAIC produced a controversial report on fake products being sold online by China s top ecommerce stores. That report slammed Alibaba s marketplace, Taobao, claiming that about 63 percent of the stuff for sale on the site is counterfeit. However, that was extrapolated from a survey of 51 products that SAIC s secret shoppers bought from Taobao. SAIC s entire report was based on just 92 products bought from six leading Chinese estores.  The reason why there are so many market violations is that the cost of breaking rules is too low,  Zhang said Monday in reference to Taobao s poor performance in the SAIC s study. He added that new regulations on ecommerce would be focused on companies   key responsibilities  to consumers in terms of  credibility and integrity.  Referring to China s online retailers, Zhang said the SAIC will  listen to them, provide guidance for them, and demand their self-discipline.
