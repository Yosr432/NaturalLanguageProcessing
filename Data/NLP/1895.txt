Instagram to Open Its Photo Feed to Ads: Instagram is cranking up its money machine, and that means a lot more ads in your photo feed. Facebook, which bought Instagram in 2012, has kept the mobile photo-sharing service mostly free of advertising, allowing only a handful of big brands to put a few carefully drafted commercial messages on the service. But on Tuesday, the company announced plans to open the Instagram feed to all advertisers, from the local tattoo parlor to global food makers, later this year. Marketers will be able to target ads to the service s 300 million users by interest, age, gender and other factors, just as they can on Facebook. Instagram will also begin testing a type of ad that allows viewers to click on a link to buy a product or install an app that is advertised. The commercialization of Instagram, while sure to disappoint some users, was probably inevitable. Major social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest have committed to keep their services free to users, and they have turned to advertising to pay the bills. Instagram offered its first ads in November 2013, but since it has been subsidized by Facebook, it has had time to develop an ad strategy. Many retailers already use third-party workarounds, such as Curalate s Like2Buy tool, to allow fans to shop their Instagram feeds. Visitors to the Instagram pages of Target, Nordstrom, Forever 21, Williams-Sonoma and other retailers can click on a special link that the store posts in its account description that leads to a mirror image of its Instagram feed   but one where photos are clickable and link to product pages where a shopper can buy the items.
