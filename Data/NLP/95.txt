Cloudera s IPO will test unicorn valuations: Cloudera filed to go public mid-day last Friday, releasing a set of financial numbers that were the locus of anticipation: How would the company s recent performance stack up to its $4.1 billion valuation set three years ago  Before Cloudera published its S-1 document   detailing its recent quarterly results and several years of financial data   reports indicated that the company would pursue a $4.1 billion valuation in its IPO, flat from its last private round when Intel poured $740 million into the company. That Cloudera might aim for a level valuation with a dozen or so quarters of additional growth under its belt was notable. (Crunchbase News reached out to Cloudera regarding the valuation figure. The company declined to comment.) The situation raises an obvious question: Did Cloudera s investors incorrectly estimate the potential future value of the company in 2014 if it intends to secure a flat valuation today  It is likely fair to say that Cloudera s investors were at least partially incorrect about where the company s value would end up by the first quarter of 2017. No one alive deploys three-quarters of a billion dollars in capital for a flat return over a multi-year period. And doubly, Cloudera may in fact still be overvalued at the proposed $4.1 billion valuation when compared to certain public market comps.
