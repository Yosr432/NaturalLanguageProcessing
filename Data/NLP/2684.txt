Despite concerns over its content, anonymous messaging app Yik Yak secured $62M in funding led by Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, according to a person close to the deal. Yik Yak differentiates itself by focusing on local communication; users chat anonymously with one another based on their location. And the company says it is highly popular within schools and universities.  The app is mostly popular with college students  but has been troublesome for middle and high schools across the country because of bullying,  reports Re/Code. Yik Yak allows anyone within a mile of the person posting the message to read it, which means it works well in school and campus settings, depending on your definition of  working well.  The Wall Street Journal s Dennis Berman points out that when you log into Yik Yak, these are the  top messages  you see   the ones with the most upvotes by users (using a similar system as Reddit does; being able to vote on posts to get them in front of more eyes.)  The messages are pretty gross.
