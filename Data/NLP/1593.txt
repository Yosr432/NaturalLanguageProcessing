Tesla Plunges 9% as Musk Grapples With SUV s Second-Row Seats: Elon Musk can t make an SUV without seats. Tesla s chief executive officer dialed back his forecast for 2015 vehicle deliveries, saying that getting the new sport utility vehicle s middle-row seats just right is proving thornier than expected. The added threat of not having enough of other interior parts puts the original sales plan at risk, he said.  Our biggest challenges are with the second-row seat,  Musk said Wednesday during a conference call with analysts.  It s an amazing seat, a sculptural work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right.  He added that some interior trim components could become roadblocks, but the so-called falcon-wing doors weren t going to be a problem. Assembly snags on the Model X, Tesla Motors Inc. s first SUV, could also slow output of the Model S sedan, Musk said. So now the company may deliver 50,000 to 55,000 autos in 2015, down from an initial target of 55,000. Tesla shares fell 8.9 percent to $246.13 at the close Thursday after plunging as much as 13 percent for the biggest intraday decline in 21 months. While lowering the bar for this year and next, Musk said he remains  confident  that Tesla will produce about half a million cars in 2020. He s said that s when investors should be able to expect the company to become profitable. Musk pointed out Tesla made 600 cars annually five years ago.  Now we can produce 600 cars in three days,  he said. As production of the SUV increases, the company will become free cash-flow positive, probably near the end of this year and  certainly  for the first quarter of 2016, Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said. Tesla has drawn down $50 million of a $750 million credit line, and left open the possibility of going to Wall Street for additional money.
