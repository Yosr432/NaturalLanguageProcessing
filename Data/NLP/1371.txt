More on the Twitter Buy Button: Twitter Makes  Buy  Button Widely Available: After two years of testing, Twitter is finally making it easy for millions of merchants to sell products through a tweet. The social network announced Wednesday that its  buy now  button will be available to any merchant in the United States that uses one of three major e-commerce platforms to run its online shopping operations. A store that is a customer of Demandware, Bigcommerce, or Shopify can use the software to tweet out a link to a product that will show up with a buy button. A Twitter user can then purchase the product in as few as two taps   one tap on the buy button and a second to confirm the purchase. (The first time people buy something through Twitter, they will also have to go through a screen to provide payment and address information.) Twitter s expansion of its buy button, which builds on a partnership with the e-commerce platform Stripe announced earlier this month, comes as competing platforms are also beginning to offer e-commerce directly from their services. On Tuesday, Google s YouTube service announced that advertisers can now place buy buttons in other people s videos   allowing, say, Apple to offer a way to buy an iPhone from inside a fan s video showing the unboxing of a new iPhone (yes, there are lot of videos like that). Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram, a photo-sharing service owned by Facebook, are also testing buy buttons. Facebook isn t so sure about Buy Buttons. Sheryl Sandberg, the company s chief operating officer, said that Facebook studied the behavior of its 1.5 billion users and concluded that buy buttons should not be a high priority right now.
