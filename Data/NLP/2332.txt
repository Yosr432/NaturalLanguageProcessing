Winds of economic change in India: as rivals falter, India s economy is surging ahead: China s economy is slowing. Brazil is struggling as commodity prices plunge. Russia, facing Western sanctions and weak oil revenue, is headed into a recession. As other big developing markets stumble, India is emerging as one of the few hopes for global growth. The stock market and rupee are surging. Multinational companies are looking to expand their Indian operations or start new ones. The growth in India s economy, long a laggard, just matched China s pace in recent months. India is riding high on the early success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a raft of new business-friendly policies instituted in his first eight months. Small factories no longer need to shut down every year for government inspectors to spend a day checking boilers. Foreign investment rules have been relaxed for insurers, military contractors and real estate companies. A broad tax overhaul is underway. Renewed optimism from outside investors is spurring business expansion in cities around the country like Tiruppur, a hub of India s yarn and textile industry.  Most of the factories in Tiruppur are doubling or tripling their capacity, and these are huge factories,  said Pritam Sanghai, the director of Arjay Apparel Industries.
