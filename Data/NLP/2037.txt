Apple, IBM and Japan Post See Profit in the Old-Age Market: Japan is an incubator of aging. More than other country, it is a graying nation. Twenty-five percent of its population, or 33 million people, are age 65 or older, more than double the global average. IBM, Apple and Japan Post Group, a giant postal service, bank and insurer, declared on Thursday that they were joining to deliver a new technology service to the fast-growing market of older Japanese adults. The service involves equipping Japan s silver generation with iPads loaded with software apps to help them communicate with family and friends, monitor their health, and buy goods and services. For IBM and Apple, the initiative is another step in the partnership they formed last year, mainly to create mobile apps for corporate workers. The project with Japan Post goes beyond the workplace into homes. Quality-of-life services for aging populations will certainly be a big, if broad and diverse, marketplace. And Japan is a prime test bed. Citing the nation s geriatric demographics, Taizo Nishimuro, chief executive of Japan Post, said,  Many countries will be facing the same issue soon.
