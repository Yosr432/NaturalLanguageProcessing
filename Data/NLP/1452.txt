It's Like PayPal But Pays Interest, and India's Banks Are Afraid. That s a concern for the nation s largest banks, because 40 percent of the money they lend comes from millions of small depositors like Mungekar. If more like her start shifting to digital money, they risk draining those deposits. Last month, the Reserve Bank of India gave licenses to 11 entities to operate so-called payment banks that will function a lot like PayPal in the U.S, but with a distinction -- customers can get interest on the money they leave there. Payment banks can t lend and can only invest the client s money in the safest government securities. Their revenue comes from a small commission on each transaction. Their new licences are part of central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan s mission to cut the nation s addiction to cash and to increase efficiency at the banks. PayTM started off as a service for adding credit to burner phones, and has evolved into the country s largest e-wallet repository, allowing customers to pay utility bills, buy bus tickets and pay for Uber rides. Now it plans to build on its base of urban middle-class clientele to become a pseudo bank -- accepting deposits, offering peer-to-peer money transfers, even providing a debit card for cash withdrawals. The payment banking license was the first step. E-Wallets may be attractive for people wary of sharing their bank or card details on the Internet. They also make it easier to reward customers with discounts and offers redeemable at online or brick-and-mortar outlets. Apart from One97, other payment bank licensees include three large telecom operators, industrial conglomerates, the state-owned postal service, and billionaire Mukesh Ambani s Reliance Industries, which plans to run its venture with State Bank of India.
