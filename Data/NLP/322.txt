LinkedIn is bringing Lynda.com courses to its news feed and building a messaging bot. LinkedIn is finally bringing Lynda.com   the online education company it bought 18 months ago for $1.5 billion   into its news feed. Beginning Thursday, LinkedIn will start recommending online courses for its members based on things like their jobs and their listed skills, and recommended courses shared by friends of colleagues. Users can take the course on LinkedIn, then add completed courses and new skills to their profiles after completion. CEO Jeff Weiner also teased out a number of upcoming products. Among them: A new LinkedIn messaging bot that will help LinkedIn users schedule and arrange meetings. The bot will pull info from users  calendars to help find time for people to meet, then suggest physical meeting locations based on where the two people have met in the past. It s the first such messaging bot from LinkedIn, which is not known for having an advanced messaging product. (It didn t even announce a text-like messaging feature until a year ago.)
