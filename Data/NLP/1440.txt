Lyft automatically opts you into receiving robocalls. That doesn t sit well with the FCC. Lyft and First National Bank are on notice for violating federal telemarketing rules, regulators said Friday. The two companies allegedly required that their customers accept robocalls and automatic text messages as a condition of using their services   a no-no under the Federal Communications Commission's regulations. The rules are meant to prevent companies from coercing customers into consenting to robocalls. Although Lyft allows users to opt out of robocalls, doing so bars consumers from using the ridesharing service, the FCC said. If the two companies don't change their behavior, that could lead to more than a warning   fines or other legal action.
