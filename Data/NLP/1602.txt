Apple Denies Planning to Sell Mobile Services Directly to Consumers: Apple, the world s most profitable mobile phone maker, has denied a report that it is working on a plan to market communications services directly to consumers that would bypass telecom operators on which it now relies. Business Insider on Monday reported that the iPhone maker was testing a so-called mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service in the United States, which would involve it renting capacity from one or more network operators to sign up its own customers. The mobile phone maker is also in talks with European operators about such an arrangement, the website reported.  We have not discussed nor do we have any plans to launch an MVNO,  said an Apple spokeswoman in a statement on Tuesday.
