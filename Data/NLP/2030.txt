IHS: Apple Inc's Watch has the lowest ratio of hardware costs to retail price across any Apple phone, according to a preliminary estimate by research firm IHS after a teardown study. The hardware cost of an Apple Watch Sport model was about 24 percent of the suggested retail price compared with 29-38 percent for the iPhone maker's other products, IHS said on Thursday. (bit.ly/1zuOZMq) The Apple Watch Sport 38 mm costs $349 and the teardown shows a bill of materials of $81.20 with the cost of production rising to $83.70 when $2.50 in manufacturing expense is added, IHS said. Preliminary estimate shows Apple Watch Sport hardware costs only about 24 percent of MSRP; lowest of any Apple product examined by IHS There are several new features and manufacturing methods used in the Apple Watch Sport, including: a Pulse Oximeter, Force Touch sensor, "Taptic Engine" feedback, encapsulated modular printed circuit board (PCB) assembly and stacked-die integrated circuits (IC).  While these features have been promoted by Apple and none are necessarily revelatory,  Keller said.  It is noteworthy that many features are appearing for the first time   in combination   in one device. It could be a bellwether for other future Apple products.
