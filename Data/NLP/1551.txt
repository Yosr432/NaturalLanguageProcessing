Alibaba Cash-Burning Buybacks Make Internet Bonds China s Worst: China s Internet bonds are lagging behind as disappointing earnings and plans for buybacks to shore up slumping shares fuel concern finances will deteriorate. Alibaba, China s largest e-commerce company, announced a $4 billion share repurchase last week, while Baidu, its most-popular search engine, unveiled a $1 billion plan in July. Their bonds have contributed to a 0.4 percent loss on technology notes this quarter, the worst sector in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment-grade dollar note index for China that gained 0.4 percent. That s a turnaround after Baidu s 2012 debut in global debt markets gave it a self-proclaimed  war chest  and Alibaba s $8 billion sale in 2014 became Asia s biggest corporate dollar bond offering. The companies  shares have slumped at least 9 percent this quarter as authorities tighten controls on Web content and crack down on fake goods online.  Companies such as Baidu and Alibaba came out with weaker results, and have announced cash-burning buybacks or acquisitions, which triggered a sell-off,  said Anthony Leung, a credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong, said.  In addition, regular negative headlines such as the sale of counterfeit goods, have hurt their bonds.
