Jay Z is selling a third of Tidal, which makes sense. Sprint is buying a third of Tidal, which makes less sense. Jay Z hasn t found a new owner for Tidal, his streaming music service. But he s getting closer. Sprint says it has bought a third of Tidal; Billboard says the carrier is paying $200 million for its stake, which pegs Tidal s value at $600 million. Sprint and the music service aren t offering any other details, except that Sprint customers will get  exclusive artist content not available anywhere else  and that Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure will join Tidal s board. Jay Z has been shopping Tidal for at least a year   Samsung, which seemed like a logical buyer, kicked its tires for a while, then walked away; everyone else gave it at least a look   so it s logical to assume that this deal gives Sprint a  path to control : The ability to buy a majority stake in the company over time. It s also logical to see why he d want to get out of the streaming business, which he entered by buying Aspiro, a Swedish streaming company, for $56 million in 2015: Everyone in the streaming music business loses money. That doesn t matter to tech giants like Apple and Amazon, who use music to promote other products. It also doesn t seem to matter to bigger streaming music companies like Pandora and Spotify, that have investors willing to bet that they ll figure out how to turn a profit, one day. But if you re Jay Z and you re running a small scale streaming business   Tidal claims it has three million subscribers, though those numbers have been disputed   then you re either funding those losses out of your pocket or getting someone else to do it for you. So an early exit would have always been part of the plan. Here s a good hunch: In a year or so, Jay Z will have sold the whole thing to Sprint, which will be left trying to figure that problem out for itself.
