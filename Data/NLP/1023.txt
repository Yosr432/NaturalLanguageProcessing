Son's SoftBank Vision at Risk as Sprint Goes From Bad to Worse: The acquisition of Sprint Corp. was supposed to help Masayoshi Son realize his vision of transforming SoftBank Group Corp. into the world s most-valuable company. Instead, the 2013 deal has become his biggest setback so far, dragging down SoftBank shares and cutting into the billionaire s wealth. SoftBank tumbled yesterday to its lowest level since the Sprint deal closed 2 1/2 years ago. Son s fortune has shrunk by $3.2 billion over the past 12 months, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as the Japanese company s stock plunged. SoftBank paid $22 billion for a controlling stake in the No. 3 U.S. wireless operator at the time. That investment has lost $7.3 billion in value, according to SoftBank, and Sprint is now the No. 4 carrier.  At the same time, a slowdown in China brought down shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., SoftBank s biggest holding, by 22 percent last year.  There will always be fans of SoftBank, it s just at this moment in time, no one cares --it s out of fashion,  said Andrew Clarke, director of trading at Mirabaud Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.  They have too many concerns about Sprint and Alibaba because those shares are being crushed.
