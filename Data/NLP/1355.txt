Samsung Electronics third-quarter profit guidance beats estimates:  Samsung Electronics said on Wednesday its July-September operating profit likely leapt 79.8 percent from a year earlier, beating expectations and pushing the South Korean tech giant's share price sharply higher. Samsung, in a regulatory filing, estimated its third-quarter profit at 7.3 trillion won ($6.29 billion), its first quarterly profit gain in two years and its biggest since the first quarter of 2014. This compared with a 6.7 trillion won profit tipped by a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate poll of 30 analysts. Samsung's shares opened 4.1 percent higher after the guidance release. Smartphone earnings likely improved from a year earlier, analysts said, partly due to the launch of new lower-end models and the August launch of the Galaxy Note 5. Semiconductor sales were also expected to be strong, driven by the launch of new smartphones including the Galaxy Note 5 and Apple's iPhone 6S models. The weaker South Korean won likely also boosted profits, analysts said. Samsung expects third-quarter revenue to rise by 7.5 percent from a year earlier to 51 trillion won.
