Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Shows Users Why 10,000-Character Tweets Aren t So Crazy: Show, don t tell. It s a general rule for writers and it was a helpful tool for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Tuesday afternoon just a few hours after Re/code reported that the company is working on a feature that would allow people to send tweets that are 10,000 characters long. (The current limit is 140 characters.) As expected, Twitter users freaked out, so Dorsey tweeted an explanation for the potential change, and he did so in many, many characters. Because Twitter can t accommodate more than 140 characters in a single tweet, Dorsey shared his much-too-long explanation as a photo instead. This is the closest Twitter has ever come to speaking publicly about the feature, referred to internally as  Beyond 140.  The product could launch as early as March, according to sources, but Dorsey didn t acknowledge a launch date in his post. It s clear, though, that Twitter isn t afraid to make drastic changes to the product in its effort to jump-start user growth and its sagging stock price.
