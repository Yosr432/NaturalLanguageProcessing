Startups continue to try and crack the attribution problem of omnichannel shoppers and cross-device conversions: The proliferation of smartphones and tablets has given rise to the  omnichannel shopper,  a retail industry term for a customer who might scope out a product from their phone, computer and local store before making a purchase. Major retailers are waging advertising wars across an increasing number of screens and storefronts in an effort to win these shoppers  business. After all, that customer could decide to buy at any point. But serial entrepreneurs Hemang Gadhia and Christopher Brown discovered a simple albeit significant problem: Retailers have a hard time tracking when that customer using their app, visiting their Web site and entering their store is actually the same person. The pair s latest venture, District-based Revmetrix, uses software to identify omnichannel shoppers as they move from smartphone to computer to tablet to store, then helps retailers determine what will motivate that specific customer to actually spend money. How will Revmetrix track omnichannel shoppers  Data, of course. As customers visit retailers online and in stores, they leave digital footprints along the way, such as the make and model of a smartphone, an IP address and a geographic location. That information can then be matched with information the retailer may already collect about its customers, such as their online shopping habits, purchase history and demographic data. At present, Gadhia said the Revmetrix software can identify the same customer on different devices with more than 80 percent accuracy. The more data that s collected, the more accurate the technology becomes.  The problem that we re solving is a problem that exists for every single large retailer on the planet,  Gadhia said.
