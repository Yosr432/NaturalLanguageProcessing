Uber switches fully to Paytm wallet-based pay mode, discontinues Indian card payments: Global online car hire service major Uber Technologies Inc has stopped accepting credit and debit card payments from cards issued in India, and will now only allow payments made through Paytm wallet in the country, the company announced in a blog post. Last month, Uber had partnered with Paytm, the digital goods and services marketplace owned by Noida-based One97 Communications Ltd, to integrate its payment system. With this integration, Uber can sidestep the regulations that require every transaction made with an Indian credit card to include two-factor authentication (2FA). Earlier, it had come under fire from Indian monetary authority RBI over its automated credit card based payment system.
