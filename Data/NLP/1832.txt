Twitter Unleashes Autoplay Video Ads With a 100% Viewability Promise: If not completely viewable, brands won't be charged: Twitter is ready to serve autoplay video, which has the potential to change up the experience on the platform with richer and more engaging media. The company has taken a hard stand on viewability standards: It is promising only to charge on video ads that have been seen 100 percent in full view of the user. Autoplay video has become a standard format in social media and one that is supported by advertisers, who like the fact that their content makes more of an impact. Here are some of the key numbers Twitter revealed about its tests regarding autoplay video: Users were 2.5 times more likely to prefer autoplay over click-to-view or thumbnail previews on videos. Ad recall was 14 percent greater on autoplay-promoted videos versus other formats. Completion rates were seven times greater on autoplay compared to other formats.
