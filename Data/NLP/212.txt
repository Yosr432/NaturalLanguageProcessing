Lyft rides a wave of anger to the top of the App Store: This weekend, Uber and Lyft   in their reactions to the Trump administration s immigration order   illustrated how important companies' political views have become to consumers. Lyft took a public stand against the order and, on Sunday, saw more downloads than Uber for the first time ever, according to analysis firm App Annie. Lyft's Sunday downloads also more than doubled its daily average over the previous two weeks. Uber, on the other hand, had a bad weekend. Hundreds of people called for ride-sharers to ditch the company through the hashtag  #deleteUber  after it announced that it would drop surge pricing for John F. Kennedy Airport trips. Many saw Uber s move as an attempt to undermine the strike that New York City cabdrivers organized to protest the immigration order and capitalize off the controversy   something Uber was quick to deny. It also didn't help Uber's standing among President Trump's critics that its chief executive is on the administration's business advisory committee. The social reaction to the Uber-Lyft divide was immediate. App Annie confirmed that Lyft climbed the app charts on both Apple and Android phones this weekend. It overtook Uber to reach No. 1 on the Apple App Store. That bump came despite the fact that Lyft didn t suspend its service during the strike either and despite Lyft's ties to another close Trump ally, investor Peter Thiel. Its pledge over the weekend, however, seemed to speak louder than those facts   and louder than a later Uber vow to devote $3 million to help its drivers with immigration legal costs.
