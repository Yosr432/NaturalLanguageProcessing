IBM forecasts weak earnings for 2016; shares slide:  Revenue fell 8.5% to $22.06 billion. International Business Machines Corp forecast weak earnings for this year after reporting an 8.5 percent fall in fourth-quarter revenue as a strong dollar and tepid IT spending weigh on Big Blue's results. Shares of the company, which receives more than half its revenue from markets outside the United States, fell 3 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. IBM has been shifting away from hardware by selling low-margin businesses such as low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services. Yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. IBM's fourth-quarter revenue fell to $22.06 billion in the quarter ended Dec. Revenue from "strategic imperatives", which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Net income fell to $4.46 billion, or $4.59 per share, from $5.48 billion, or $5.51 per share, a year earlier. Up to Tuesday's close, IBM's shares had fallen 18.5 percent in the past 12 months.
