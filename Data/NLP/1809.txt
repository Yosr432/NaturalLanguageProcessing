Twitter Expands Shopping Experience With Product Pages: Twitter is finally taking advantage of its massive amount of tweet data to encourage its users to shop.The social network is rolling out product pages and what the company calls Collections on Friday, distinct pages within the service where you can see info on specific products or places and actually make a purchase. A product page will include things like tweets about the product, user reviews, pricing and, in some cases, a buy button. Collections are more of a browsing experience, which include a handful of recommended products and places selected by a brand or high-profile curator. For example, Ellen DeGeneres has a Collection highlighting the  Best of the Ellen Shop,  where you can browse Ellen-branded products or others she has featured on her show. The new feature is a pretty expansive change to Twitter s previous shopping experiments. Those were limited to promoted tweets that included a buy button for a single item. The Collections and product pages aim to take advantage of the fact that Twitter already has lots of information about products and services from its user base. It s now collecting that info to help educate a potential buyer. For now, Twitter is simply getting the product off the ground and isn t taking a cut of sales revenue from most partners, but taking a slice off the top seems like a logical next step.
