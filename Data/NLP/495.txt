Tesla Falls After Paring Delivery Forecast Amid Factory Strains: Tesla Motors Inc. fell after the electric-car maker missed second-quarter forecast for global deliveries and lowered its full-year outlook, citing an  extreme  increase in output in the period s final month. The shares slid 3.3 percent to $209.40 at 9:35 a.m. New York time. They declined 9.8 percent this year through Friday. Deliveries of 14,370 vehicles trailed a projection of about 17,000, after an  extreme production ramp  came too late in the quarter to get the cars to their buyers, Tesla said Sunday. About half of the quarter s output in the final four weeks.The carmaker has had trouble getting its vehicles to customers fast enough to meet its targets even after increasing production. Tesla said 5,150 cars were still on trucks and ships making their way to clients who ordered them, and will be delivered in the first part of this quarter. Tesla is increasing output at its Fremont, California, factory with an eye toward making 500,000 cars a year by 2018 -- an ambitious timeline that also depends on the carmaker s battery factory east of Reno, Nevada, coming online with battery-cell production. Tesla missed its deliveries forecast for the second time in a row this year. In the first quarter, the company blamed the shortfall on  hubris  in adding in too much new technology that led to part shortages for the Model X.
