Amazon's strong Q4 profits (and slowing revenue) were both driven by a surge in marketplace: "Q4 2014 was whene Amazon flexed its marketplace muscles: After analyzing all the data, this quarter was a real stand out for the Amazon third-party marketplace.   In fact, Amazon has started to open the kimono a bit on how much they reveal about the 3P business (particularly FBA) and it was all very strong in Q4.  In fact, I d go so far as to say the marketplace simultaneously drove the improved margin picture at Amazon and the revenue decline (will describe that in a future post). Acceleration   As mentioned above, the 3PM really accelerated to levels we haven t seen in a long, long time.  33% y/y growth in a 15% e-commerce backdrop is quite impressive. 3P unit share   Another stand out metric from Q4 was Amazon announced that 43% of paid units came from third party sellers. Paid item growth -Paid item growth came in at 20%, flat with Q3. Media share   Media hit a low-water mark of 24% with EGM at a high-water mark of 70% (the missing 6% is other -ads and AWS). Geographical mix - Amazon s revenues were 64% North American and 36% rest of world (Amazon s largest regions outside the US are Germany, Japan and UK).  See below for the details on geo mix. Active users   If there was a blemish on Q4, it was units/user and active users.  Active users grew only 16% y/y to 270 (a slow-down from Q3 s 16% growth rate). Units per user   One interesting metric is the units/user   this metric shows us buyer frequency.  In other words, are buyers increasingly active or decreasing activity. Of course, increasing is good and programs like Prime, and recommendations and upsells are working.  Units per user was up .6% which is a bit of a slowdown."
