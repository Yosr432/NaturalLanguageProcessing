25,000:1 - that's the ratio of data center machines to employees at Facebook, says FB's VP Engineering: While most enterprises have a ratio in data centers of one person for every 250 to 500 computers, Facebook has 25,000 machines for every person, Mr. Parikh said. Facebook s entire network, he said, is overseen by just one person at any given time. Given Facebook's employee strength of ~10,000, this implies that its data centers could have ~250M machines; similar calculations would place Google at between 25M and 50M machines.
