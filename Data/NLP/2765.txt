Amazon's very weak earnings (rev $20.8B, 20% Y/Y, net loss $544M) and slowing growth outlook (Q4 at 7% to 18% Y/Y) triggered a sell-off; also the company took out a $2B line of credit to meet working capital requirements recently: Amazon reported lower than expected revenue in its third quarter, and a larger than expected loss. Analysts expected the company to lose $0.74 on revenue of $20.84 billion. Instead, Amazon lost $0.95 per share on revenue of $20.58 billion. Shares were down 10% after-hours. Investors were particularly spooked that forecasts for Q4 were weak too -  I think that the potential for a loss in the fourth quarter is what is freaking people out,  one analyst said. Last month the company revealed it had taken out a $2 billion line of credit with Bank of America for  working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.  Revenue growth - long Amazon's stated objective - could slow sharply next quarter.
