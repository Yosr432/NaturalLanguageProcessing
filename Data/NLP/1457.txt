Alibaba lowers second-quarter gross merchandise volume estimates. Alibaba said on Tuesday it expected second-quarter gross merchandise volume (GMV) to be lower than its initial estimates due to weaker consumer spending in China. The company's shares reversed course and slipped as much as 3.1 percent to $61.91 in late afternoon trading. They had earlier gained as much as 4.5 percent. Alibaba said it now expects GMV to be lower in mid-single digits on a percentage basis from its earlier estimates. Up to Friday's close, the company's shares had fallen about 39 percent this year.
