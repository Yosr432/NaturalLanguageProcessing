A small Canadian city tries to drag intersections into the 21st century: Have you ever sat pointlessly at a red light  There s no cross-traffic, but the traffic light is clueless, so you re forced to wait. Miovision chief executive Kurtis McBride feels your pain.  I can t count the number of times I ve been sitting at a red light with no cars around me and just wondering,  Why am I stuck in this situation,    McBride said. His Canadian start-up is bringing modern technology to an industry that is years behind. Smart intersections could learn the traffic patterns and adjust the length of red and green lights to optimize the flow of traffic. Sitting at a pointless red light would be a thing of the past. Miovision envisions full automated intersections that are powered by algorithms. One Canadian transportation agency is currently testing Miovision s technology in seven intersections on major arteries in Cambridge, Canada. The Waterloo Region wasn t ready to go all-in on automated intersections, but is trying the technology to learn of malfunctioning lights, and adjust the timing of its lights. Miovision, which is based near Waterloo, raised $30 million earlier this year from investors.
