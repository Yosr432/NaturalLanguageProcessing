New, Simple  Buy  Buttons Aim to Entice Mobile Shoppers: Despite spending close to three hours of each day staring at their mobile phones, Americans continue to do the vast majority of their online shopping through desktop and laptop computers, which have larger screens and physical keyboards that are more amenable to browsing and typing in credit card numbers. Mobile phones are projected to account for about half the time Americans spend online this year, but only about one-fifth of retail e-commerce sales, according to eMarketer. Now several companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, are trying to bridge the gap between mobile browsing and desktop purchasing with a simple  buy  button. Buy buttons have been around since the early days of the web, of course, notably with Amazon s  One-Click Ordering,  where people set up a button that runs their credit card and ships whatever they have bought to a designated address. But these new buy buttons allow technology companies to act as middlemen between mobile shoppers and retailers   extending one-click ordering to thousands of small retailers and eliminating exasperating typing on a phone s touch screen. The logic for the companies working on the new buy buttons is that, in an increasingly mobile world, where people do less typing and more tapping, a more predictable checkout process will drive sales by reducing  friction,  which is a technology industry euphemism for any inconvenience, no matter how small, that might cause people to wonder why they are opening their wallets.
