Search After the Search Box: Google Now Pushes Into the Next Frontier of Mobile Behavior: Google Now, an intelligence layer on Android and the Google app that was launched in 2011 is beginning to spring to life. In January, the service started integrating with popular apps, pushing notifications customized around personal data. This summer the product team is rolling out Now on Tap, a new Android feature that weaves Now into apps (and, likely soon, mobile websites). It s search without the search bar   and, sometimes, without the query. Aparna Chennapragada, the Google executive who has run Google Now, its AI-driven smart personal assistant, since the start of this year, spelled out the three-pronged direction of the product   what she called the  bets  her team is taking. The first bet was embedding Now with Google s full  Knowledge Graph    the billions-thick Web of people, places and things and their many interconnections. The second is context. Now groks both the user s location and the myriad of signals from others in the same spot. If you enter a mall, Now will tailor cards to what people in that mall typically ask for. And this is where the third benchmark for Now comes in: Tying that context to the apps on your phone, or ones you have yet to download. In two years, Google has indexed some 50 billion links within apps. In April, it began listing install links to apps deemed relevant in search. Indexed apps will be included in Now on Tap when it arrives in the latest Android version this fall.
