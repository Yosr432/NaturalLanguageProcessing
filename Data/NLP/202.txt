Financing growth with debt in the app economy: Smart developers consider accounts receivable (AR) financing or venture debt as suitable sources of financing because they are generally low cost and don t dilute their equity. However, many often don t read the  fine print,  which can lead to them signing away more than they need to. So how can you avoid this increasingly common pitfall One of the keys to making the right financing choice is understanding the concept of liquidation preferences. When lending money, banks or venture debt providers will require you to pledge certain assets as security against the funds advanced. This is known in the U.S. as a lien (or a charge in the U.K.). Liquidation preference determines which creditors are paid out first if your company ends up in financial difficulties and goes into receivership.The assets you pledge as security should be appropriate for how you re going to use the money you borrow. For example, if you re borrowing money against your receivables to fund growth, you should only secure the loan against your receivables. Generally speaking, if an asset can be clearly defined, there s no reason other assets should be included as security, although lenders will often try to include wider coverage as it improves their overall security position in the event of any default. Here s an analogy: When you take out a mortgage to buy a home, you must pledge your home as security for the loan. But the bank doesn t ask you to also pledge other assets like your vehicles or your future earning capacity (in other words, your personal intellectual property).
