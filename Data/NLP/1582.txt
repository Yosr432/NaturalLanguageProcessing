Alibaba to invest $4.6 billion in China electronics retailer Suning; JD.com falls 6% on news: JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, sank to a four-month low after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. s purchase of a stake in the country s biggest electronics chain threatened to increase competition. The American depositary receipts plunged 6.3 percent to $30.06 in New York on Monday. Trading volume of 21.2 million ADRs was more than double the daily average of the past three months. JD.com, which gets more than half of its revenue from electronics and appliances, declined as most stocks on the Bloomberg China-U.S. Equity Index rose. JD.com slid after Alibaba, China s biggest online retailer, said it will spend $4.6 billion to become Suning Commerce Group Ltd. s second-largest shareholder with about a 20 percent stake. The ADRs extended their drop to 21 percent from this year s high in June as concern mounted that stiffer competition will further slow sales growth in an industry already beset by the country s slowest economic expansion in 25 years.
