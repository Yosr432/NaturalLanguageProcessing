Google Parent Company Spins Off Self-Driving Car Business: Google s parent company, Alphabet, said on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company under the name Waymo. Alphabet s decision to spin out Waymo is a signal that the company thinks its self-driving technology has advanced beyond research project status and is ready for commercialization. Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers   all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry. Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning   the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time   mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years. The challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesn t have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares   at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesn t have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain. It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems   akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google.  Google has struggled to find a way to come to market,  said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics.  We ve come to the point where Google needs a return.
