Financing in the Dell-EMC Deal: Under the terms of the deal announced Monday, EMC has negotiated a "go-shop" provision in the preliminary deal that gives it the opportunity to seek out other buyers. Yet analysts say that while the Dell deal may slightly undervalue EMC shares, it's still a good deal. Shares of EMC rose about 1.5 percent during regular trading Monday. While the company will be a private concern after the deal is closed, a portion of its shares will continue to trade publicly. EMC investors will receive roughly $33.15 per share   they will receive $24.05 per share and a type of publicly tradeable stock "linked to a portion of EMC s economic interest" in VMWare. Dell plans to pay $24.05 a share in cash plus tracking stock in EMC s prize holding, software maker VMware Inc., valued at about $9 for each EMC share. EMC s stock climbed 1.8 percent Monday to $28.35. Dell will add almost $50 billion to its debt load to complete the purchase, people familiar with the matter said, on top of the $11 billion it already is carrying. The combined company will be run by Michael Dell, the chief executive officer of the company he founded and took private for about $25 billion two years ago. He is financing the takeover with his MSD Partners investment vehicle, Silver Lake and Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings. He also is using debt, the VMware tracking stock and cash on hand. The deal will combine EMC s dominance in devices that store data with closely held Dell s No. 2 position in servers, the powerful machines that help companies handle big computing challenges.
