Evernote's new app turns smartphones into scanners via image-to-text conversion software: Scannable, an app from the note-taking service Evernote, turns your smartphone or tablet into a scanner by simply taking a picture of the document you want to record. Using recognition software, the app can then identify the words on the documents you re scanning, so that you can search for keywords later. It will scan business cards and let you create new contact cards on the iPhone or iPad straight from the app   no typing required. The app doesn t pick up every thing on a document, particularly if papers have been folded or crumpled. If you re working on something for an official application or document, you may still want to opt for the old-fashioned scanner. But if you re looking to keep quick notes or add contacts to your address book in a pinch, it s reliable, free and easy to use. Free, for iOS devices.
