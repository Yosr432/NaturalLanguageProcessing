Netflix Profit Rises 56 Percent to $67 Million, Adds International Subscribers; Shares Jump 8%: Netflix added a record 7.05 million streaming members in the three months that ended Dec. 31, up from the 5.59 million net additions in the same period of 2015. That growth, in domestic and international markets, beat its forecast of 5.2 million new members for the quarter. Netflix now has a total of 93.8 million members. Fueling the increase in subscribers was a rapid rise in Netflix memberships abroad. The company said it is learning  how best to match content with audiences tastes around the world.  It added 5.1 million international members in the quarter, and now has 44.4 million members outside the United States, more than 47 percent of its total membership. Netflix cited its original series  Marvel s Luke Cage  and  The Crown  as worldwide hits. It said it planned to invest more than $6 billion in content this year, up from $5 billion in 2016. Profits are rising steadily. Net income increased 56 percent to $67 million in the quarter from the same period in 2015. The company projected that profits would reach $165 million in the current quarter, up from $28 million in the period a year ago.  We don t really believe in hockey-stick businesses, like suddenly we will turn significantly profitable at 200 million members,  Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said during a conference call.  We think it is much smarter to grow into that bit by bit.  Netflix s stock price is typically volatile on days when the company reports earnings, and Wednesday was no exception.
