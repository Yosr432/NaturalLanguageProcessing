Israel s Best-Performing Tech Stock Hasn t Sold a Single Product: Occupying a small, second-floor space in the same office park as 3D printing giant Stratasys, a tiny Israeli upstart is trying to sell investors on a future in which physical objects materialize with the press of a button. Nano Dimension is nowhere near achieving that goal, yet somehow has become Israel s best-performing technology stock in 2015. While Stratasys lost nearly three-quarters of its value last year, the much smaller Nano Dimension rallied 261 percent. Not bad for a company with no customers or revenue. This little 3D printing shop, with 44 employees and a market cap of 193 million shekels ($49 million), has become a source of hope for Israeli entrepreneurs struggling to secure venture capital. That s because Nano Dimension took an unorthodox route to raise about $18 million and become a public company, while managing to avoid the long, costly process of an initial public offering.  Nano Dimension found its way onto the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange using what s known as a reverse merger. This involves a private company taking over a public one, bypassing the formalities of an IPO.  We re selling shares like any other public company,  said Amit Dror, the chief executive officer of Nano Dimension.  It s just that it happens to be that our case is a public company that s pre-revenue.
