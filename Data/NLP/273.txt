Rent the Runway has raised a $60 million investment led by Fidelity; The company was profitable in 2016 on revenue north of $100 million. In March, Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman told Recode,  I think you need to assume it s impossible to raise equity financing for the next two years.  Just nine months later, Rent the Runway has closed a new $60 million equity investment led by the mutual fund company Fidelity with additional money from existing investors like Bain Capital Ventures and TCV. What changed in that time  The startup best known for its dress rental business put together a profitable year on an Ebitda basis while growing its revenue to well over $100 million. Rent the Runway also launched a new product   a $139-a-month rental subscription for everyday workwear   that accounted for more than one-fifth of total company revenue in its first year. The deal underscores a renewed focus on profitability for investors and fast-growing startups alike. Just this week, news broke that the subscription meal-kit company Blue Apron   another Fidelity portfolio company   was pausing its IPO plans to focus on widening its profit margins. The investment is another bet by Fidelity, which has also backed both Uber and Airbnb, on the so-called sharing economy. In this instance, the belief is that more women will view clothing rentals beyond dresses as the norm in the future. The valuation of this Series E investment was a  significant step up  from the $520 million valuation Rent the Runway earned when it raised a $60 million round in 2014. Hyman declined to provide more specifics on the new valuation other than that it was based on the types of metrics and multiples on which public companies are valued.
