Youtube retools annotations for mobile : Youtube is finally retooling a troublesome feature, making it more useful for content producers and hopefully a bit less frustrating for users. Annotations, YouTube's clickable pop-ups (which, to be clear, are still available for the moment) are being joined in the company's toolbox by a new feature called "cards," which, to every advertiser's delight (and most users' chagrin) will now work on mobile. The good news is that cards will take up a relatively minimal amount of video real estate when they first appear, showing teaser text that, if clicked, will pop up more information. At later points in the clip, a small "i" will indicate the presence of cards.
