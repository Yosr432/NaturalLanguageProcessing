No One Wants to Be  the Next Square  Anymore: Makers of once-prominent credit card readers are retrenching or outright folding after Square s disappointing IPO. A year ago, being known as the  Square of Canada  was a badge of honor. Payfirma Corp. s smartphone-compatible credit card readers were in high demand, and local investors supplied the Vancouver startup with $13 million in funding. Like Jack Dorsey, the chief executive officer of Square Inc. (and Twitter Inc.), Payfirma CEO Michael Gokturk said he was aiming for  hypergrowth.  Gokturk doubled his staff to 80, including a chief operating officer formerly of Intuit Inc., and started talking about an initial public offering. But by November, being the  Square of  anywhere suddenly wasn t such a hot title. That month, Square sold shares in an IPO that valued the company at about $2.9 billion, less than half its private valuation from a year earlier. In the runup to the IPO, analysts began questioning whether the card-reader maker should really be priced like a high-flying tech company. Its stock price is hovering around $13, right where it was after its first day of trading.  Now that they started going through the rigors of a public market, you can see that their market is actually quite limited,  said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.  It s going to be much harder going forward for companies that try to emulate their model to raise capital.
