Apple's revenue from China this quarter: $16.8B (+71% Y/Y) - sells more iPhones in China than in the US Apple s growth engine has now shifted unmistakably to China. The company said on Monday that quarterly iPhone sales in greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, had surpassed those in Apple s home market, the United States, for the first time. While Apple did not disclose specific numbers, the performance powered the company s revenue, with sales in greater China rising 71 percent to $16.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter compared with the same period last year. Revenue from greater China also exceeded that from Europe for the first time. The China results punctuated another strong quarter for Apple. Apple has long laid the groundwork to reap big sales in China, and revenue growth from the region has steadily gained momentum. The company in late 2013 struck an important deal to sell iPhones through China Mobile, the world s largest phone carrier. Apple is also expanding its operations in the region, with 21 retail stores and plans to increase that number to 40 by mid-2016. Add to all that the fact that the Chinese New Year holiday, typically a big retail season, was in February. The latest iPhones also have much bigger screens than past models, another feature that has been especially popular in China. Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, said Apple s performance in China highlighted its advantages against other American technology companies.  It s hugely important because it shows that Apple continues to be the only major U.S. tech company that is really succeeding in China, in contrast to Google, Microsoft and Amazon,
