Raising Money Is Like Buying Dinner, Spending Money Is Like Getting Fat: How A Big Round Can Hurt Your Startup: When you re a struggling team eating away at your meager savings and trying to get your startup profitable, venture capital funding seems like the holy grail. Raising money from investors gives you the resources to grow your team, buys you time to do things properly and gives you no small amount of credibility in the eyes of other entrepreneurs, prospective hires and even some clients   not to mention mom and dad thinking you re now successful. While all of this is true, there s a pervasive belief in the industry that entrepreneurs should aim to raise as much money as possible, as often as possible. It might be true in some circumstances, but here are three reasons why raising as much money as possible is often not in the best interest of the entrepreneur or the company. Raising Money Is Like Buying Dinner, Spending Money Is Like Getting Fat, and Raising Big Rounds Is Like Stunt Driving. In the end, it s most important as an entrepreneur that you focus on the right decisions for your company. Don t raise funds to get a big splash in the tech press. Don t push for the biggest valuation to please preferred stockholders. And don t optimize for the fanciest publications or the most street cred. All of those things are fleeting sugar highs of entrepreneurship. Plan for the long-term success of your company by knowing how much you actually need and stopping once you hit that number.
