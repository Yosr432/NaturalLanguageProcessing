Facebook Audience Targeting could be changing politics just like it is changing the news business: Modern political campaigns home in on their key voters with drone-like precision, down to the smallest niche   like Prius-driving single women in Northern Virginia who care about energy issues. They compile hundreds of pieces of data on individuals, from party registration to pet ownership to favorite TV shows. Some platforms are now tailoring their offerings to meet the campaigns wherever they are. Facebook, for instance, at its most basic level allows campaigns to focus their message on a particular ZIP code or gender, or even a group of voters that  likes  a certain set of Facebook pages   maybe MSNBC s Rachel Maddow and The Nation, or Fox News s Sean Hannity and Guns & Ammo magazine. At a more sophisticated level, a campaign can upload its entire voter file to Facebook, and work with one of the site s data partners to reach only its targets with messages designed specifically for them.
