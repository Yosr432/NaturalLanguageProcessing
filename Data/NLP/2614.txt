Big data companies are acting far more as services companies than they hope to be eventually: Data science, as a business, is still young. As the technology moves beyond the Internet incubators like Google and Facebook, it has to be applied company by company, in one industry after another. At this stage, there is a lot of hand craftsmanship rather than software automation. So the aspiring software companies find themselves training, advising and building pilot projects for their commercial customers. They are acting far more as services companies than they hope to be eventually. For now, the technical hand-holding and pump-priming is an essential step.

But its costs surged, resulting in a net loss of $86.7 million, well more than double its total revenue.
