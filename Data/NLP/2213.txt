Tesla to have Autopilot on its cars by summer:  Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, took a big step when he announced that the maker of high-end electric cars would introduce autonomous technology by this summer. The technology would allow drivers to have their cars take control on what he called  major roads  like highways. Mr. Musk said that a software update   not a repair performed by a mechanic   would give Tesla s Model S sedans the ability to start driving themselves, at least part of the time, in a hands-free mode that the company refers to as autopilot. Also to be added are tools to help drivers monitor the status of charging stations and plot routes to ensure the ability to complete a trip without running out of battery power. The move is intended to help reduce so-called range anxiety, the fear drivers have that their battery will run out, prompting them to constantly calculate distances and worry about being stranded.
