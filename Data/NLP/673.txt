Instagram is selling a new type of video ad: Instagram has been pushing users to create more video content. Now it s pushing advertisers to create more video ads. Instagram announced Tuesday that it will soon roll out video carousel ads, a move that will let advertisers share up to five separate videos with one single ad purchase. Each video can be up to 60 seconds long. Instagram already sells carousel ads, the kinds of ads that let users swipe between different pages (often called cards). But video functionality wasn t available until now. The change aligns with Instagram s conscious push into video more broadly, a strategy reminiscent of Facebook s video push a few years back. Instagram is adding video featuresand making video more prominent in search in hopes users will watch more of it. It s essentially feeding people what it wants them to consume   and video can be good business. If users expect to see videos when they open Instagram, then video ads, which are typically more lucrative than static ads, won t feel out of place. These new video ads are now in beta and will roll out to all advertisers in the  coming weeks,  according to a company spokesperson.
