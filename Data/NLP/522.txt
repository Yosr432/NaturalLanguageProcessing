Uber switches out surge for price transparency: No more pop-ups asking you to agree to those murky  2.1x  (or some other  x  amount) surge fares on the Uber app. Soon Uber will just tell you the price of your ride up front. Uber pricing will still fluctuate with demand, but now you ll know the dollar amount you ll be paying for the ride, instead;  no math and no surprises,  says Uber. The new costs are calculated similarly to the old  x  surge pricing so you might still end up paying a ridiculous sum in certain places or times of day where demand for a ride home is going to be high. The price is based on expected time, distance, traffic, the number of riders requesting rides at that time and the number of drivers available nearby, but at least now you ll know exactly how much of a punch the ride will make to your bank account. Uber will also allow either the driver or rider to update the app if you change your destination in the middle of the ride and says you ll get a notification in the app with the change in price. The rideshare company also told me you won t have to worry if your Uber driver goes way off the map and tries to charge you more or if the route is suddenly busy and they need to change course. The price you agreed on will still be the price you pay. So no more lightning bolts and pop-up screens asking you to agree to  3x  surge or whatever it is after you stumble out of the bar or head all the way across town. Just like with hotels and airfare, the prices change all the time, but you ll know what the price is before you book. According to Uber,  hundreds of thousands of riders  have already received the pricing transparency rollout   including those in Miami, San Diego, Seattle, New Jersey, New York and some of the bigger cities in India like Mumbai and Hyderabad. Uber plans to roll out the changes to pricing in the app globally in the next few months.
