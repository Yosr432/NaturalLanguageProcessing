Silicon Valley's obscure unicorns could boost 2017 IPO market: Social media firm Snap Inc may be the highest profile tech IPO planned for 2017, with the potential to raise billions. But more than a dozen expected stock offerings of relatively obscure software firms targeting business customers - little-known names such as Apttus, Tintri and Okta - could be just as important in thawing a long-frozen IPO market, according to investment bankers and advisers who work on IPOs.Such enterprise software companies generally sell their services through subscriptions that produce reliable revenue streams. They aim to sign contracts lasting several years, giving investors more predictable returns than many Internet or consumer-oriented companies that depend on advertising or high volumes of individual transactions. The firms provide a range of back-of-the-house services, such as automating business processes, security, accounting, training software and expense management. Although such companies have moderate valuations, between about $500 million and $4 billion, the sector accounts for most of the tech IPO market. Apttus, for example, helps salespeople give a price quote quickly when trying to close a complicated deal that includes different products.
