eBay might cut 10% of its workforce, primarily in marketing, and increases its (small) investment in Indonesia: Ebay is considering eliminating almost 10 percent of its workforce, or about 3,000 employees, the WSJ cited one source as saying. The cuts are expected to be localized in the company'smarketplace division, the report said. Separately, US-based ecommerce giant eBay plans to increase its ownership in Indonesia s MetraPlasa from 40 percent to 49 percent, local media outlet Berita Satu reports.  Ebay can increase to 49 percent and they can also have the option to become the majority shareholder. There are stages for them to get there and they want to do it quickly. But I can not disclose anything more,  said Telkom s acting president director Indra Utoyo in Jakarta on Monday. Ebay remains a strategic partner for Telkom as it will allow for future cross-border trading, and for products on the Blanja site to eventually be sold overseas. Blanja claims to have one million products on its site from only 600 sellers. It recieves a mere 50,000 visitors per day.  Currently, the revenue contribution of ecommerce to our business remains small,  says Utoyo.  But we estimate the contribution could reach 10 percent within two to three years.
