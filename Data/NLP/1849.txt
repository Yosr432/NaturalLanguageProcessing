Amazon s E-Books Business Investigated by European Antitrust Regulators. European regulators announced an antitrust investigation on Thursday into whether Amazon used its dominant position in the region s e-books market to favor its own products over those of rivals. The European Commission said it was evaluating the legality of clauses that Amazon had used with European publishers, which required them to inform the e-commerce giant of more favorable terms for books that were offered to other digital retailers. The announcement is the latest hurdle facing United States technology companies in Europe. European policy makers in recent years have pursued a series of tax, antitrust and other investigations into the businesses of Apple, Google and Facebook. The European authorities said the clauses being evaluated in the e-books investigation might have hampered competition by making it more difficult for Amazon s rivals to offer lower prices. Amazon has been estimated to sell about eight out of every 10 e-books in Britain. In Germany, the percentage is just under half. In the United States, Amazon has an estimated two-thirds of the e-book market. The investigation is at an early stage and still could be dropped or end in a settlement without a formal finding of wrongdoing. If formal charges, known as a Statement of Objections, are eventually brought against Amazon and Amazon fails to successfully rebut those findings, the company could face a fine of as much as 10 percent of its most recent annual global sales.
