It's been a decade since Amazon introduced its Prime service, which waives fees for two-day shipping and includes perks such as access to Amazon's streaming video library -- for $99 per year. When Amazon first announced Prime in a 2005 earnings call, skeptics wondered how the company would make the then-$79 annual fee palatable to consumers -- and how it was going to foot the bill if the program caught on. A decade later, Amazon says Prime memberships number in the tens of millions and are growing. Over the past year alone, memberships have shot up 53 percent. On the day after Christmas, Amazon said 10 million people had signed up for Prime "this holiday season." Greg Greeley, the vice president of Amazon Prime Global:  Prime introduced three concepts. It had two-day shipping at a time when people expected to pay for shipping and still not get their items for four to seven business days. It was very predictable: We put it on the Web site that if you ordered in the next 3 hours and 20 min., for example, you could have it in two days. And it was an unlimited, single membership fee that made fast delivery an everyday experience instead of an occasional indulgence. They are much more engaged. One of the benefits to them and us is that we re top of mind -- they don t have to drive around for a hard-to-find item. On the app or on the PC, they're engaged on the other benefits as well. Prime offerings are always either [fulfilled by Amazon] or retail.
