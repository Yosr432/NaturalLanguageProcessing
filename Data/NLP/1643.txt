EBay Ends Same-Day Delivery in U.S. in Face of Amazon Effort: EBay Inc. is killing its U.S. same-day delivery service EBay Now, an acknowledgment it won t try to match the speedy delivery of e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The online marketplace hinted the service wasn t performing last year when it canceled the EBay Now mobile application and encouraged its use on desktops. The program had been available in the San Francisco area, New York, Dallas and Chicago. Amazon has invested heavily in same-day delivery, offering the service for free to Amazon Prime subscribers in New York, Seattle, San Francisco and other large cities.
