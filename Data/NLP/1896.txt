More On Instagram's Monetization: Instagram Unleashes a Fully Operational Ad Business With shopping links and Facebook-powered targeting: Instagram's ad business is growing up fast thanks to a boost of new technology from Facebook. Today, the popular photo-sharing app with more than 300 million users and counting is opening up to potentially millions of advertisers, with more ad styles and sophisticated targeting tools first honed by its parent company. Instagram is launching ads with "Shop Now" buttons and other messages that link outside the app so users can take marketable action. Also, there's a new API software platform that lets marketing partners automate the advertising process. The API comes polished able to manage, track and measure marketing campaigns thanks to borrowed technology and lessons learned from Facebook, said James Quarles, Instagram's global head of business and brand development. Advertisers can reach users based on more than just their ages and genders, targeting interests gleaned from Facebook profiles. "We have benefitted greatly from being a part of Facebook," Quarles said. "It would have taken us years to build this tech stack for ourselves. So, we're fortunate to be able to take select pieces of Facebook's tech stack."
