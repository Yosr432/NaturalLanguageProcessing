Amazon Is Now Selling Its Own ARM-Based Chips: An Israeli company acquired by Amazon last year has announced a new line of semiconductors, marking Amazon s first foray into the chipmaking market.

The company says that its chips are designed for Wi-Fi routers, media streaming devices, connected home products and data storage gear, and that they ve already been used in commercial products from Asus, Netgear, and Synology.
