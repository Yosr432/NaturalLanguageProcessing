Ellen Pao resigns as Reddit chief executive: Ellen Pao has resigned as interim chief executive of Reddit, the popular online message board, following widespread user criticism of the way she was running the company. Reddit announced the change Friday afternoon in a company post, saying that the resignation was "by mutual agreement." Pao will be replaced by Steve Huffman, Reddit's co-founder and original chief executive. Pao, who had been at the company only eight months, came under withering criticism for firing a popular employee, Victoria Taylor, the company s director of talent. Taylor was beloved among Reddit's powerful moderators, who don't work for the company but have complete editorial control over the thousands of niche discussion sections on virtually every topic, including cute animals and depression. Reddit's message boards draw about 160 million active users. Taylor was also a rare, public female face at Reddit and in tech world. Amid the vitriol directed at Pao, many users pointed out the irony that Pao would have let go a prominent woman at Reddit right after losing a bruising, high-profile gender discrimination suit earlier this year. After Taylor's dismissal, moderators revolted, shutting public access to hundreds of discussion boards over several days. Users also circulated an online petition, that has gathered more than 200,000 signatures, calling for Pao to step down. Pao posted an apology this week for the way the Taylor firing was handled. On Friday, she released a statement on Reddit saying that she resigned because "the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit s core principles."
