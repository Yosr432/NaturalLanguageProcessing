Reddit launches a crowd-funding site as it attempts to monetize non-intrusively: Reddit, where users find, share and talk about web links and photos, has been faithful to an antiquated design and still looks like an online message board plucked from the 1990s   think Craigslist, but with more Lolcats. You don t need to hand over any personal data, not even an email address, to sign up and post or view an item. The huge online community message board site unveiled Redditmade on Wednesday, a crowdfunding initiative that allows Reddit users to raise money to manufacture and sell customized items. The move will add another revenue stream to Reddit, which has tried to find creative ways to make money from the millions of people who visit the site without angering its quirky community of Internet denizens. Reddit has grown enormously in popularity over the last five years but only recently started focusing more on making money. Reddit now makes money from a small e-commerce site, Reddit Gifts. It also sells Reddit Gold, a subscription program that offers perks for signing up. Its largest moneymaker by far, however, is advertising.
