YouTube struggles to monetize despite its enormous engagement..:  For all of its influence as a cultural force, YouTube is still finding its way as an economic one. Viewers may be migrating online in droves from traditional television, but the advertising dollars have not yet followed. The marketing research company eMarketer estimates that YouTube will log about $1.13 billion in ad revenue in 2014, a small fraction of the $200 billion global TV advertising market. The quality of most YouTube programming is too unpolished to draw big investments from many blue-chip advertisers. YouTube creators, meanwhile, complain that the company takes too much of the ad revenue   as much as 49 percent   and does too little to market and promote its stars, which makes it hard for them to leverage their celebrity.
