Now, a selfie-makeover app with a clear monetization model: Photox (pronounced like Botox) allows users to submit candid photos to a team of editors who will give it a touch up   or overhaul   depending on what changes the subject wants to see made. The edits can range from minor tweaks, such as teeth whitening or eye color correction, to near-surgical changes, including breast and butt enhancements, full-body weight loss and bald spot coverup. Once a user uploads his or her photo to the app, they are presented with more than 30 editing options. Each edit requires a certain number of credits, and each credit costs 99 cents. Removing a tattoo or scar requires one credit, or 99 cents. Erasing the photo s background runs nine credits, or $8.91.  We have a lot of people using a photo from their family vacation as a LinkedIn headshot and you would never know it was taken at a restaurant or on the beach,  Imperiale said. If you haven t been hitting the gym lately, Photox can add six-pack abs ($3.96), give you skinny legs ($3.96) or bulk-up your arms ($2.97). If it s a dermatologist you desire, the app can also minimize wrinkles ($2.97), lighten skin ($3.96) and remove acne (99 cents).
