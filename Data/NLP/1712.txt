Across Asia, investments in technology start-ups have risen to levels comparable to the United States.: In the first six months of this year, 46 Asian start-ups, including Apus, have had fund-raising rounds of $100 million or more, just short of the 48 in North America, according to the research firm CB Insights. The focus of investors in Asia   China and India in particular   reflects an increasingly decentralized reality in global technology investment. Asian banks, private equity firms, venture capital funds and hardware and Internet giants are all willing to invest in domestic start-ups. And American investors are increasingly willing to back Asian players with advantages in their home markets. China and India have two of the world s largest smartphone markets, and investors are particularly interested in finding ways to make money from these giants. Small hardware companies that use their knowledge of China s electronics supply chain to make sensors and novel devices like drones are also drawing attention   realms of technology not yet dominated by the current power players in the industry, namely Apple, Google and Microsoft. In India, the two largest investments were made by the American hedge fund Tiger Global Management and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Alibaba and its finance affiliate Ant Financial invested $575 million in the Indian mobile commerce company One97, while Tiger made a $500 million investment in India s leading e-commerce site, Flipkart. Tiger Global has yet to make an investment in the United States this year and has focused 82 percent of its new investments in India at companies in their early stages, according to a June report from CB Insights.  India is one of the youngest countries, and their mobile penetration is low,  said Michael Dempsey, an analyst for CB Insights.  With more than a billion people, why wouldn t it be one of the next major tech hubs  That s what investors are thinking.
