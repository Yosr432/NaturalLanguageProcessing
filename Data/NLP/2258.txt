As Alibaba stock continues to slide, firm announces a re-org, brings Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan into a newly created division: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd appointed Jeff Zhang to oversee its main services on Monday, bringing Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan into a newly created "China Retail Marketplaces" division. The appointment marks one of the highest-profile personnel shuffles since China's largest e-commerce company went public in September. Together with the creation of the new division, the move will streamline operations and enhance efficiency. The company, which now handles more ecommerce than Amazon.com and eBay Inc combined, has been struggling to sustain the rip-roaring pace of growth it enjoyed in past years as it gains scale. It's unclear how Zhang's appointment affected Yilei Wang, who was President of the Amazon.com-like Tmall retail website. On Monday, Chinese news website sina.com reported that Wang had been dismissed from his post, though the company declined to comment on his current situation. Shares in the company ended 2.2 percent lower at $82.53 on the New York stock exchange.
