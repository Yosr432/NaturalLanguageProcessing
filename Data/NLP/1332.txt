Apple Is Said to Deactivate Its News App in China: Apple has disabled its news app in China, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, the most recent sign of how difficult it can be for foreign companies to manage the strict rules governing media and online expression there. The Apple News app, which the company announced in June, is available only to users in the United States, though it is being tested in Britain and Australia. Customers who already downloaded the app by registering their phones in the United States can still see content in it when they travel overseas   but they have found that it does not work in China. Those in China who look at the top of the Apple News feed, which would normally display a list of selected articles based on a user s preferred media, instead see an error message:  Can t refresh right now. News isn t supported in your current region.  Greater China is now Apple s second-largest source of revenue after the United States, with sales of more than $13 billion in the third quarter. That means the company is most likely taking a careful approach to delivering new content, like that on its news app, within China. Beijing generally insists that companies are responsible for censoring content inside China. In Apple s case, that would mean it would probably have to develop a censorship system   most Chinese companies use a combination of automated software and employees   to eliminate sensitive articles from feeds. For now, Apple seems to be avoiding the problem by completely disabling the service for users in China.
