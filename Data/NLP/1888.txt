Coke's New Twitter Ads Call Out Viewers by Name As Social Promos Get Personal. Coca-Cola has been buying Promoted Tweets that show up in viewers' Twitter feeds and address them by their first names. The ad copy starts with: "Hey [NAME], #ShareACoke is back! Order..." You can see the full promo in the above image. The new tactic is part of a larger, ongoing "Share a Coke" campaign that debuted earlier this spring. The company is encouraging people to buy 8-ounce bottles of the soda, personalized with their names, for $5 apiece. Coke wasn't available for comment. But it appears the Atlanta-based soda giant is employing Twitter's Tailored Audiences platform in an innovative way to create this targeted style of advertising. Twitter deferred to Coca-Cola about the campaign and didn't state whether other brands were using the personalized call to action. But it would certainly interest any marketer that is looking to increase its click-through rates on the microblogging platform.
