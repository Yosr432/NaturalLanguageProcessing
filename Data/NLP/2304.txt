HP Q4 earnings: $26.8B -5% Y/Y, net income $1.4B, -4% Y/Y; stock down 7% on earnings miss: Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard s chief executive, says she thinks her company did almost everything well in its most recent fiscal quarter. Except make money. HP shares tumbled about 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, after the release of first-quarter earnings that showed drops in revenue and net income, and flat to lower sales in almost all product areas. The company also sharply lowered its outlook for annual earnings. For the quarter ending Jan. 30, HP reported revenue of $26.8 billion, a fall of 5 percent from a year ago. Net earnings were $1.4 billion, down 4 percent. Using nonstandard accounting popular in the tech business, per-share earnings were 92 cents. The revenue numbers were worse than expected in a survey of Wall Street analysts by Thomson Reuters. They thought HP s revenue would be $27.3 billion. Per-share were 91 cents. Ms. Whitman said that HP was not cutting back on research and development, despite the lower earnings, and said valuable new products were on the way, particularly in business computing. Another bright area, she said, was HP s security software business, thanks to the hacking last year on Sony Pictures. While there had been earlier violations of corporate computers, she said, Sony took the business up to a new level.  We re sold out   5,000 security professionals.
