Amazon's typical data centers have 50K-80K servers, and there are 28 such data centers globally: Amazon has 11 cloud regions across the world, said James Hamilton, an Amazon distinguished engineer, during a presentation at re:Invent. Each region has multiple sets of data centers, and there are 28 total sets across the world. Each of those has one or more data centers, with a typical facility containing 50,000 to 80,000 servers. A conservative estimate puts Amazon over 1.5 million servers globally. Lydia Leong, an analyst at research firm Gartner, puts it at 2 million or more. By comparison, Rackspace Hosting has a little over 100,000 servers spread across six data centers. Google has three regions with eight total sets, and Microsoft has 17 regions. Last year, Steve Ballmer, then Microsoft's CEO, said the company had over a million servers within its data center infrastructure and that Google had even more. Amazon's cloud could soon get even bigger. Hamilton told me that he saw no reason why Amazon couldn't eventually have a data center in every U.S. state if companies adopt cloud computing as enthusiastically as people predict.
