Amazon Launches  Pay With Amazon  Buttons for Mobile Apps: Amazon says it is finally ready to turn its huge customer base into a big payments business outside of Amazon. For real this time. The e-commerce giant is bringing its  Pay with Amazon  buttons to mobile apps, while  tripling down  on placing its Pay with Amazon buttons on websites in overseas markets like Japan. The moves are the latest in the company s on-again, off-again efforts to take advantage of the more than 200 million customer accounts it has on file by processing payments on websites outside of its own walls. Earlier this year, Amazon hired PayPal vet Patrick Gauthier to lead a newly created team dedicated solely to building a payments business across the Web and app world. The payments industry is watching closely. For years, it has been waiting for Amazon to become a real player, perhaps challenging PayPal along the way.
