Amazon s $5 Dash Button Already Hacked To Do Other Stuff Beyond Giving Amazon Money: Need something to spark a bit of creativity this week  How about a super clever hack for Amazon s $5, single-purpose Dash buttons  The Dash buttons were originally meant to serve as a quick way to reorder household goods you order often (Order a lot of laundry detergent  Stick a Dash button on your washing machine, press it when you re running low. Bam. Ordered.), but Cloudstitch CTO Ted Benson has found a way to make them do pretty much anything he wants. You can read Benson s full breakdown right over here, but here s the gist: Benson noticed that the Dash sends out a unique signal each and every time it s pressed. Rather than opening up the Dash and modifying the hardware itself (which would probably require all sorts of painful/tedious chip flashing), Benson sniffs the network for that signal. When it s detected, he can fire a script to do just about whatever he wants. In his demo use case, he s using it to record when his baby s diaper gets changed into a Google Spreadsheet, while a second button records when his baby wakes from a nap. To keep the Dash from ordering any products when you press it, you just  don t configure it to order a product during the inital setup. If you never enter a SKU, it won t have anything to order. One catch: whereas the factory Dash can act on its own, a modified Dash will need something   a computer, generally   awake and running on your network to sniff out the button presses and respond accordingly. It complicates the equation a bit, but it s still a fun hack.
