Verizon finally to allow complete opt-out of mobile  Supercookies : (more coverage here)Verizon Wireless, which has been under fire by privacy advocates since late last year, has decided to make a major revision to its mobile ad-targeting program. Users who do not want to be tracked with an identifier that Verizon uses for ad-targeting purposes will soon be able to completely opt out, the company said on Friday. In the past, Verizon allowed users to opt out of the marketing side of the program, but they had no option to disable being tagged with its undeletable customer codes, which critics dubbed  supercookies.  Some security researchers quickly illustrated that third parties, like advertisers, could easily exploit Verizon s persistent tracking to continually follow a user s web browsing activities. In a recent interview, Praveen Atreya, a Verizon director who helped develop the technology behind the mobile marketing program, said the company was considering allowing its subscribers to opt out of being tagged with its undeletable customer codes. On Friday, Verizon confirmed this decision. But even if Verizon now allows subscribers to opt-out of having their online activities tracked using a unique customer code, that option may not satisfy privacy advocates who say consumers are unlikely to understand the implications of default tracking. Some say Verizon should have the feature turned off by default and require people to voluntarily switch it on. But whether Verizon ultimately gives its subscribers the choice to opt out or opt in, cyber-security experts say Verizon will still have to grapple with a basic issue: how to prevent third parties from hijacking its unique customer codes for their own purposes
