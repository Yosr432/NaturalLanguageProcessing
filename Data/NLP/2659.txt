Smart home-audio market continues to heat up - Sonos raises $130M:  After Amazon's launch of Echo, and Apple's purchase of Beats, Sonos, in the smart home audio business since 2002, just raised $130 million, according to an SEC filing. The funding adds to Sonos  previous $325 million, bringing it to around $455 million. That makes it a very, very well capitalized startup. It s so big that probably no one but Google or Apple could afford to acquire it. Considering Apple s personal audio buyout of Beats  headphones business, and Google s invasion of the smart home, either could be a smart alternative to an IPO for Sonos. Sonos has been steadily improving its core product   home stereo systems where each room can be separately controlled to wirelessly play music from online and local sources. It ditched its proprietary controller to let you use iOS and Android devices as remotes, and eliminated the need for its  Bridge  gadget you had to plug into your wireless router. Alongside Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, Deezer, Sirius XM, and your own music library, Sonos recently added support for SoundCloud and Google Music. What s left is to become a household name. Sonos has already begun buying expensive commercials on primetime music TV shows like The X Factor. It s also running huge outdoor ad campaigns on the sides of buildings in Europe
