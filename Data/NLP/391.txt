Peter Thiel says journalism will be just fine, since he ll decide what s good journalism: Peter Thiel is a billionaire who decided he didn t like Gawker Media after it outed him as gay. So he funded Hulk Hogan s lawsuit against the company, and they won. Now Gawker is selling itself in a bankruptcy auction. Today, the same day that bids for Gawker are due, Thiel published an op-ed in the New York Timesas a sort of victory lap, but also to muster votes for a bill currently wending its way through Congress, the Intimate Privacy Protection Act. It's more commonly known as the revenge-porn bill, which would make it illegal to transmit private images and messages, but Thiel has co-opted it for his own purposes, referring to it by a lesser-known nickname, the Gawker Bill. But the most interesting part of Thiel s editorial is what he says about the need for a free press: It s telling that despite the fact he felt Gawker had invaded his privacy, Thiel himself never filed a lawsuit   he s fighting via proxies. In trying to determine what should and shouldn t qualify as journalism, Thiel is exercising the classic Silicon Valley pretension to attempt to own the definition, to write its own narrative, devoid of context or skepticism. But smart publishers will react to Thiel s call to arms in a similar vein to the closing words of his editorial: He can t do it, if we don t let him.
