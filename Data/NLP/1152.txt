Some Twitter Users Call Foul as It Switches Moments and Notifications Buttons: Twitter moved Moments for Web and Android viewers yesterday to where the Notifications button once was, causing considerable consternation among faithful users. In a nutshell, many in the Twitterati thanks to muscle memory are reflexively tapping the Moments button by accident when they want to check their notifications. Numerous tweets accuse the company of tricking users.  San Francisco-based Twitter has declined comment. But the move raises the question as a few of the tweets above hint at about whether or not the social media company is happy with the metrics that Moments has been getting so far. The end of the fourth quarter is near, and newly re-appointed CEO Jack Dorsey would certainly like to tell Wall Street investors during the next earnings call that Moments is drawing a big crowd. Twitter has made Moments a centerpiece development since Dorsey came back to the helm. Additionally, Digiday reported this week that Twitter's ads for Moments, called Promoted Moments, have an asking price of $1 million. So it stands to reason that Twitter needs Moments to scale in order to make such a purchase worth it for brands.
