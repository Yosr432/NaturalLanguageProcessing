YouTube has a new music service... What is YouTube Music  YouTube Music is a new app from Google that lets you specifically search for music on the site. That means you get more focused results   a search for "Prince," for example, won't bring up videos about royalty. Well, not of the non-musical variety, anyway. The app will also suggest other songs that you may like, based on your preferences. Doesn't YouTube already have a music service  You may remember that YouTube previously launched a service called YouTube Music Key, which was in an open beta, and seems to have been discontinued in light of the new service. how does this work with YouTube's new subscription service, YouTube Red  Subscribing to YouTube Red, Google's new ad-free subscription service, will get you access to ad-free versions of YouTube, YouTube Gaming and YouTube Music, plus Google Play Music. That will cost you $10 per month if you're an Android user and $13 per month if you're on iOS. You will be able to use the YouTube Music app for free, but those who don't pay will still see ads and not have access to some of the more advanced features. How does this stack up against other services  You could always listen to YouTube, with ads, for free, so why would you pay for that  There are a few perks that may convince you. For one, you no longer have to leave the soundtrack of your day up to the whim of the auto-play algorithm or take the time to actually make your own playlists. Plus, on mobile, you couldn't just keep it running in the background   if you wanted to listen to YouTube, that was all you were going to do. YouTube Music fixes all of these problems. Can I download it now  Not yet. You will have to wait a little while. Although YouTube Red will launch next Thursday, the Music portion of it is scheduled to be out only by the end of the year.
