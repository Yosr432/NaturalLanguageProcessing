EBay Forecast Beats Estimates as Traffic Efforts Pay Off: EBay projected sales on its marketplace for the second quarter and full year that will meet or exceed analysts  estimates, suggesting efforts to boost traffic, such as using barcode scanning and a more searchable catalog, are gaining traction. Since separating from PayPal last year, Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig has been under pressure to reverse sluggish growth at EBay in the face of competition from Amazon.com Inc., which continues to woo shoppers with fast delivery, and after Google changed its search algorithm in a way that hurt EBay traffic. The shares rose 2.1 percent to $24.98 in extended trading after the results were announced. They ended the day at $24.49, up 1.1 percent, and are down 11 percent so far this year. Revenue in the second quarter will be $2.14 billion to $2.19 billion EBay said in a statement Tuesday. The average analyst estimate was for $2.14 billion. For the full year, EBay said it expects revenue of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion, compared with analysts  estimates of $8.73 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, will be 40 cents to 42 cents a share in the current quarter, EBay said Tuesday, compared with analysts  estimates of 44 cents. EBay s Gross Merchandise Volume -- the total value of goods sold on the marketplace -- of $20.5 billion in the quarter was up 1 percent from a year earlier.
