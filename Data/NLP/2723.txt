As Alibaba sells $2B in the first hour of Singles  Day, 4 questions analysts are asking: (1) Can Alibaba break US$9 billion in GMV  Last year, Singles Day spenders spent nearly US$6 billion across Alibaba s marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall. That was nearly double what the sale took in the previous year, and this year Alibaba will be looking for similarly massive growth. (2) Can mobile sales break 50%  Mobile sales accounted for about 36 percent of Alibaba s overall sales in Q2 of this year, so breaking 50 percent this Singles Day could be a stretch. (3) Will this year s Singles Day go international  Through programs like Tmall Global, the company has increased the number and profile of international brand names on its ecommerce platforms, and today s results should reflect how well that s panned out. For example, Tesla automobiles go on sale on Tmall for the first time today. (4) Will delivery get better and faster  Alibaba has put a great deal of effort into improving the logistical side of its business through projects like its new Cainiao subsidiary and its new partnership with Gooday distribution.
