GoPro revenue plunges 47 percent, but beats estimates: GoPro's quarterly revenue plunged 47.4 percent, but beat analysts' estimates, which have been sharply lowered on shrinking demand for the company's body-mounted point-of-view cameras. The company's shares were up 2.4 percent in volatile trading after the bell on Wednesday. GoPro's revenue fell to $220.8 million in the second quarter ended June 30 from $419.9 million a year earlier.The company, whose cameras are worn by surfers, skydivers and other action junkies, said second-quarter units shipments rose 8 percent to 759,000 compared with the first quarter. Its average selling price increased 11 percent sequentially and 14 percent on a year-over-year basis. GoPro, however, maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $1.34 billion. GoPro posted a loss of $91.77 million, or 66 cents per share, for the second quarter.
