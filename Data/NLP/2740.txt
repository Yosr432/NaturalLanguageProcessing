Caught off-balance by Holiday season demand surge last year, US retailers (a) boost demand planning (b) hire more (c) push in-store pick-up: Last year hundreds of millions of gifts and bad weather overtaxed United Parcel Service and FedEx, leading to shipping delays and empty space under the tree. Given the expected spike in online sales, the big question will be whether retailers and carriers can plan well enough to avoid the same problems.   We started talking to our customers much earlier this year, and we were planning together with them for their volume forecasting,  she said. U.P.S. and FedEx, which typically hire tens of thousands of extra workers around the holiday season, plan to hire even more this year, both companies said. And they are taking other steps, like adding more sorting facilities and technology to help track packages. At the same time, they will also be crossing their fingers to avoid the abysmal weather that delayed shipments last year (FedEx even has 15 full-time meteorologists on staff). But the onus is not just on the carriers. Major retailers like Walmart and Target are also taking steps to make sure that customers get their gifts on time. Target is planning an even bigger marketing push to get customers who order online to pick up their gifts in the store, a feature the company introduced last year, a Target spokesman, Eddie Baeb, said.
