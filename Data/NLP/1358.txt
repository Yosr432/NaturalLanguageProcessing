Facebook Gives Viewers 3 New Ways to Engage With Their Favorite TV Shows, Challenges Twitter for second-screen supremacy: Facebook is trying to steal some of Twitter's thunder, aiming to be the first choice among second-screen viewers, people who watch TV and engage on social media at the same time. So, this morning Facebook with its 213 million monthly active users in the U.S. announced new tools aimed at helping TV producers better engage audiences during live broadcasts.  1. Hashtag voting and polling: This feature should get broadcasters the most excited. Instead of being directed toward separate apps within a show's Facebook page, users will be able to vote directly within a top-level post or comment. 2. Photo and video submissions: Facebook is giving viewers or aspiring contestants on competition series the ability to submit photos and videos directly to show pages. Those can be anything from video questions (Fox News used this to solicit questions for August's GOP debate) to funny submissions for late-night talk shows or audition videos. 3. Custom icons: Taking a page from Twitter's playbook, Facebook will create custom icons much like Twitter's custom emojis for certain events such as the Oscars, the Emmys, The Bachelorette and sporting events like the Rugby World Cup.
