Google Guns for Apple in Mobile Payments Race: Google announced on Monday that it has cut a deal with three wireless carriers   AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon   as well as their jointly-owned payments company, Softcard, to have its Google Wallet payment application preinstalled on Android phones sold by the carriers. As part of the deal, Google said, it acquired  technology and intellectual property  from Softcard. The move will allow Google to get its Wallet app in front of a whole lot more people, but it is facing an increasingly crowded field. Last week, Samsung acquired Loop Pay, signaling its move into mobile payments. Apple s Apple Pay, meantime, has  been available for only a few months but has already signed up dozens of companies that report consumers are finally starting to warm to paying for things with their phones.
