Lyft hit a record of 14 million rides last month with run-rate revenue of as much as $500 million: July was a record month for Lyft, which performed 13.9 million rides, according to a letter the company sends its investors on a monthly basis that Recode obtained.That s 1.5 million more rides, or 12 percent more, than the company performed in June 2016 and amounts to 167 million rides on an annual run-rate basis, according to the document. The company also hit more than $2 billion in what it calls net ride value for the first time in its history, on a run-rate basis. Net ride value   not to be confused with Lyft s revenue   is the amount passengers pay without accounting for tips and tolls. Lyft takes anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of the fare, which means the company s run-rate revenue for the year is between $400 million and $500 million. The leaked document comes at a time when the company is under pressure to sell right after Uber sold its China operations to homegrown competitor Didi. The two companies have essentially agreed to operate a monopoly in China after years of battling for customers and riders through price enticements that made it hard to turn profit. Market dominance is more important than ever as ride-hailing startups look to turn a profit. Uber is likely to seek an IPO next year, and Lyft will have to find a buyer to help it better compete.
