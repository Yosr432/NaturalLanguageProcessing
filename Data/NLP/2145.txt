Xiaomi ends exclusive arrangement with Flipkart, will sell on Amazon, Snapdeal, others in India: When Xiaomi first launched in India last July, the Chinese gadget maker did so with online-only sales through one ecommerce store   Flipkart. That ends today as Xiaomi s India boss, Manu Kumar Jain, announced a wide array of new ways for Indian consumers to buy its smartphones or tablets. Xiaomi has tapped Airtel India s stores for sales before with the Redmi Note 4G, but the sales channels through Amazon India, Snapdeal, and The Mobile Stores are brand-new. The Mobile Stores has 300 outlets across the country. In addition to that, Jain announced today that Xiaomi would do away with its pre-registrations for flash sales of its Redmi 2 and Mi Pad in a sign that the company is better able to produce supply to meet demand. Xiaomi s flash sales have been criticized by some users for proving frustrating.
