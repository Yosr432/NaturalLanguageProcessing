Indian startups cut jobs as funding slows down:  I don t know what is going to happen now,  said Ankit Agarwal (name changed), a TinyOwl sales person who was sacked last week. His words summarise the predicament of around 1,700 persons who lost jobs in the Indian startups in the last three months.  We got a mail on Tuesday saying there will be a meeting to discuss future plans. We first thought it had something to do with our half-yearly appraisals,  Ankit explained how he and 24 others at TinyOwl s Pune office lost jobs. He did not want to reveal his real name, fearing it would affect his future job prospects. After much publicised 36-hour drama involving gherao of a co-founder, police intervention and local politicians  entry into the startup s premises, the sacked employees managed to get their full and final settlement that 15 of their colleagues who were fired in the previous month have not got yet. However, all of them will have an uncertain Diwali since their frantic job searches are met with stoic  we-will-get-back-to-you  responses. The actual number of job cuts could be even higher than the estimated 1700 lay-offs across well-known internet startups such as Housing, Zomato, TinyOwl and LocalBanya, as many such cases go unreported. Firings and shutdowns happen rather routinely among many 50-100 employee startups.
