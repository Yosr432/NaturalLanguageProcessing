U.S., world stock markets slide as panic in China spreads: A collapse in China s ailing stock market spread like contagion across the globe again Thursday, pummeling nervous investors looking for respite from the week s rocky trading. Chinese stocks traded for less than 30 minutes, slumping 7 percent and triggering the second emergency market closure this week. The action prompted markets in Europe to retreat and then spread to the United States, where stocks tumbled 2 percent. China s CSI 300 had traded for only 14 minutes before the first circuit breaker kicked in, calling a 15-minute halt to trading after a 5 percent fall. But instead of calming the market, it caused only more panic. When trading reopened, prices soon fell further, triggering a halt for the rest of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks, and the Standard & Poor s 500, a broader measure of the market, both fell about 2.3 percent. They have lost about 5 percent of their value the week so far. The tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered the deepest losses, falling 3 percent on Thursday. It is down about 6 percent this week and on pace to enter a what s known as a correction, meaning the index will have fallen about 10 percent from its most recent high. The sell-off was widespread, even hitting tech giants Apple and Amazon, which were down 4 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. JPMorgan Chase slid 4 percent, while Nordstrom tumbled 5.5 percent.
