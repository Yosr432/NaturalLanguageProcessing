Alibaba cloud unit sets sights on Amazon in $1 billion global push: Alibaba said on Wednesday it would invest $1 billion into its Aliyun cloud computing arm to challenge Amazon.com's lucrative Web Services division, opening a global front in the battle between the two e-commerce giants. With the global cloud computing market estimated by analysts to be worth about $20 billion, Alibaba said in a statement the investment would go toward setting up new Aliyun data centers in the Middle East, Singapore, Japan and Europe. The firm also plans to strike business partnerships with telecom and enterprise technology providers in those regions. Although Alibaba and Amazon have so far avoided competing directly in their core business of e-commerce outside China, Aliyun's international expansion takes aim squarely at Amazon Web Services (AWS), an increasingly central and profitable division of the Seattle-based company. Amazon shares soared last week after the company reported, among other items, an 81 percent revenue increase for AWS, which hosts Web customers like Netflix and Airbnb. As it expands, Aliyun will face stiff competition from some of the biggest names in technology. Amazon led the global cloud infrastructure market with a 28 percent share in 2014, trailed by Microsoft, IBM and Google Inc at 10, 7 and 5 percent, respectively, according to Synergy Research Group. After Amazon made a limited "beta" entry into China last year, where cloud adoption rates by businesses are far lower than in the rest of the world, Aliyun opened a data center in Silicon Valley in March to serve U.S. customers. "Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether that's in customers, technology, or worldwide scale".
