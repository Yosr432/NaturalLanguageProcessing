Amazon's non-US eCommerce business (EGM-only, not media) constitutes ~20% of total revenue and grew about 19% Y/Y in Q3: That's one of many interesting insights in a deep-dive by a well-known Amazon blogger. Amazon's geographical mix for the Q was 63% North America (growth 25% Y/Y), 37% non-domestic (13% Y/Y).  Amazon's 1P and 3P businesses are doing quite well and the problems are in media (25% of total revenue, which grew only 4%) and  non-seller oriented areas such as the Fire phone which had a  $170m write-down for the Q and Amazon is sitting on $83m in inventory. On a 2x2 of (EGM v Media) and (US v International), US EGM was the largest (~50%) and the fastest growing segment (31% Y/Y): every other segment is growing below the average. Amazon reported $20.6B in Q3 revenue, at 20% growth.
