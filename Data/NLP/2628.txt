Google launches offline viewing of YouTube videos in India, Indonesia, or the Philippines: This new feature will allow users to download a movie over wi-fi at home, and then watch it offline on a mobile device during the long commute to work, or watch their favorite videos over and over again for up to 48 hours after downloading them just once   without having to stream it repeatedly. They simply have to sign in, pick the video they want to watch later, and tap the offline button to download it. Besides India, the feature is available on Android devices in Indonesia and the Philippines too.
