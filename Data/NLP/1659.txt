Qualcomm Reports Lower Earnings and Says It Will Cut Jobs: Qualcomm had one of the best playbooks in tech, but it looks like the game is changing. The semiconductor designer and maker helped develop much of the technology used in mobile communications, particularly in smartphones. Qualcomm was a pioneer in the radio technology that makes it possible to send enormous amounts of data over wireless networks without clogging them. Virtually every maker of phones and wireless infrastructure needs to draw off Qualcomm s intellectual property, which the company leases. The knowledge and profits Qualcomm earned from that business gave it both capital and a head start in building chips for phones, first in advanced third-generation, or 3G, digital networks, then in the succeeding 4G systems.With a market capitalization of $100 billion, over the last 15 years it became the world s third-largest chip company in terms of revenue. Little of that was on display Wednesday, when Qualcomm reported lower earnings, and, under pressure from Wall Street, announced it would cut about 15 percent of its staff, or somewhere between 4,500 and 5,000 people. Spending will be reduced by $1.4 billion, the company said, including $300 million in shares that Qualcomm has been giving to its top executives and employees. Three new board members, approved by Jana Partners, a Wall Street investment firm that had been pressing for changes, will be put on Qualcomm s 15-member board. Qualcomm said its third fiscal quarter s net income was $1.2 billion, down 47 percent from a year earlier. Net income was 73 cents a share, down from $1.31 a share. Revenue fell 14 percent, to $5.8 billion, from $6.8 billion last year. The numbers were slightly higher than analysts had expected. The price of Qualcomm shares was down about 1.8 percent in after-hours trading.
