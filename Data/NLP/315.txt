Snapchat s camcorder goggles are creepy cool and kind of brilliant: Snapchat s first hardware product is a pair of $130 sunglasses that shoot first-person bursts of circular, wide-angle video. The Spectacles, as they re called, are designed to make it easy to record what you re actually seeing, in the moment, without having to awkwardly fish your giant smartphone out of your pocket and hold it in front of your face. The resulting recording is intended to be more lifelike, too.the last big camera-goggles launch, Google Glass, went about as poorly as possible. Glass, a too-serious attempt to put a computer on your face, looked ridiculous in a bad-taste, cyborg way. It introduced a creepy privacy violation   a face-mounted camera that you, as a bystander, couldn t control   with poor explanation. Its early adopters,  Explorers  who spent $1,500 for the privilege, were derided as  Glassholes,  widely mocked, and sometimes abused. The whole thing came across as a poorly planned embarrassment. Spiegel is obviously trying to avoid these problems. Strategically, though, Spectacles are potentially brilliant. If Spectacles can intercept the smartphone camera and become the creative device that people use for any decent amount of recording   in what seems to be a proprietary format, with a custom-designed distribution network in Snapchat   that s a pretty awesome position to be in.
