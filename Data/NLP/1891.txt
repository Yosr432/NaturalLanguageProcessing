Facebook Messenger Ditches Constant Mapping To Lay Groundwork For More Location Features. Facebook is removing the confusing, slightly creepy always-on location sharing feature in Messenger for a more explicit, one-time way to share where you are or will be. Location will no longer be a  second class citizen , Messenger Head Of Product Stan Chudnovsky tells me. Instead, Messenger has big plans for GPS features, saying  What we re launching is the foundation of everything that s coming.  For example,  You might want to make reservations. How are we all getting there  Maybe there s a transportation service somehow  Chudnovsky hints. When I ask if Messenger might build on Uber s API to let you instantly book rides, he coyly replied  I didn t say that, but that doesn t mean I don t like what you re saying.  The new design for location sharing in Messenger is rolling out today for everyone on iOS and Android. It banishes the blue arrow and any way to constantly share your coordinates. It s replaced with a pin button alongside those for sending photos, stickers, or money, or an option in the three-dot More drawer. Tapping it pulls up a map with your current location pinned, which you can send to friends with one more tap. This makes it easy to tell a friend  Here s where I am, come meet me.  By dragging the map, you can change the pin s location. That lets you pick a meetup spot. You can also use suggestion of nearby Facebook Places like local businesses, or search for one to set the pin to a specific destination. Chudnovsky says trying to do something similar by opening Google Maps would take  7 taps, 2 app switches, and 150% frustration.
