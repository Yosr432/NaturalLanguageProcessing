Lenovo Joins Smartphone Compatriots for  Make in India : Lenovo started making smartphones in India, becoming the largest Chinese company to produce mobile devices there after the government raised import taxes. Lenovo will use contract manufacturer Flex s factory outside the southeastern city of Chennai for its Lenovo and Motorola brands, Amar Babu, chairman of Lenovo India, said Tuesday in a phone interview. The brands will have a combined annual capacity of 6 million units, Lenovo said in a statement. Foxconn Technology Group this year began producing smartphones in India for China s Xiaomi and OnePlus after the Indian government raised taxes on some foreign-made goods to attract investment in manufacturing. Lenovo s announcement marks the largest Chinese name yet to be lured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s Make in India campaign as competitors vie for a share of the world s third-largest smartphone market.  Output from the plants is focused mainly on serving the Indian market,  Babu said. Lenovo has no immediate plans to develop phones specifically for India, he said. Lenovo considered adding smartphone manufacturing to its own personal-computer plant in Puducherry in the southeast before deciding to outsource to Flex s existing factory in Sriperumbudur, Babu said.
