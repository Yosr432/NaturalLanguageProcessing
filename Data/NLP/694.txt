A Silicon Valley VC says investors from China are joining Series A deals, and they re playing  hardball : On valuations: The average thing coming out of Y Combinator is probably a half to three-quarters of what it was [in terms of valuation in recent years]. The average seed-stage deal is half. On hardball tactics: Docs are taking longer because there are new investors coming in, and they want more stuff in their terms. These are newer investors, often foreign investors, who are basically saying:  I want senior preference to [a company s earlier] investors,  and that s adding two or three weeks as they usually ask right as the docs are closing. They re almost all from China, and they want all of their preferences to be senior to everyone else s. What s happening is, since they know the capital s financials, they just wait it out. By that point, we ve already signed a term sheet and turned off a lot of other people who wanted to invest. These things never come up in the term sheet phase but later in the docs. They ll say,  We did our diligence, and we need XYZ to invest.  It s not a great way to start a relationship. People in the ecosystem around here are playing for the long term; they realize that sooner or later, they ll be on the other side of the table and don t want this stuff applied to them. This is mostly coming from Asia, where they play much harder hardball than here. And [these investors] do it with a happy face. That s just the environment [to which they re accustomed]. On the slowdown in tech valuations:  I don t expect it to pick up any time soon, which is a function of retail and institutional investors looking for high-growth stories with profit associated with them. They want profit and growth. Meanwhile, a lot of companies that have strong revenue can t show that growth, and vice versa. There just aren t a lot of companies that could sustain being public right now.
