Fitbit Cutting 6% of Workforce as Results Miss Estimates: Fitbit Inc. will eliminate about 110 jobs, or 6 percent of its workforce, and said fourth-quarter results won t meet analysts  estimates amid declining demand for its fitness trackers. Fitbit expects to report that it sold 6.5 million devices in the quarter ended Dec. 31 2016, with revenue of $572 million to $580 million, the company said in a statement Monday. Analysts were expecting $736.4 million, on average. Fitbit forecasts revenue in 2017 of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Analysts had estimated $2.38 billion. Official results are due to be released Feb. 22. The shares fell the most in almost three months, tumbling as much as 14 percent to $6.17 in New York. That s the lowest intraday price ever for the stock, which has dropped more than 50 percent in the past 12 months. Fitbit has struggled to maintain momentum for its watches, which were initially popular as a way to track steps and encourage exercise, but then quickly relegated to gadget status. At the same time, they re facing competition from Apple Inc. s watch and cheaper Chinese models. Chief Executive Officer James Park has been trying to turn Fitbit into a digital health company that relies less on consumers and sells a range of technology to the health-care industry. But that strategy will take years to unfold. "The magnitude of the miss is surprising," said Joe Wittine, an analyst at Longbow Research. "This is nothing that Fitbit screwed up on necessarily, it s just that like all consumer products, eventually you hit maturity. The question is how does Fitbit respond here."
