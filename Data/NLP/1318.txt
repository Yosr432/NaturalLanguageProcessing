It s not just Twitter: Snapchat is laying off workers, too: Snapchat, the app that's best known for its disappearing messages, is stepping back from creating Netflix-style original content. You might not have realized Snapchat was even in the business of creating scripted shows. But in a move that likely reflects its poor performance, the effort has been shut down   and now the 15-member team responsible for it is being disbanded. Among those leaving  Marcus Wiley, a former Fox comedy executive whom Snapchat hired to run its program planning and development. Snapchat's "Snap Channel" was one of a number of content streams available on the company's app. It appeared on the Discover tab, running alongside partner channels from CNN, BuzzFeed and ESPN, among others. As those companies ran their content on their Snapchat feeds, Snapchat itself produced shows such as "Literally Can't Even" and "Pillow Talk," a casual talk show set in a bedroom where the host and guests appeared on camera in their pajamas. Unfortunately for Snapchat, these shows weren't enough to keep the channel going. After less than a year, the company made the decision to shut down the Snap Channel, a move that convinced Wiley it was time to go.
