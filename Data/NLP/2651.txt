Mobile shoppers care about: efficient checkout: As users take to mobile platforms in greater numbers, retailers are learning that small-screen shoppers are different: They buy fewer things and have less patience for a checkout process that is anything less than incredibly efficient. Also, while shoppers did plenty of browsing this holiday season on their cellphones, tablets and PCs still reigned for actually making purchases. Smartphones accounted for 34.7 percent of traffic on Black Friday, but just 11.8 percent of sales.  Also, bad signs for Google: Tablet shoppers were more likely to reach the company's site through a search engine this holiday season, while smartphone users were more likely to come from Facebook or other social media.
