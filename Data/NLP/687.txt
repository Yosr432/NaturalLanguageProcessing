Amazon s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record:  Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports. Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon reported net income of $513 million, or $1.07 a share, up from a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago. Amazon s share price jumped more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after the results were released. Investors were happy to see the company show profits after the disappointing run of reports from Apple, Google,Microsoft and Intel. The biggest source of the company s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software. Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million. The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S.   up 64 percent from a year earlier   amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.
