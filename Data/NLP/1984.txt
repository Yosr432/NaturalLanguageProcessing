Amazon Unveils Advertising Platform for Mobile-App Developers: Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new advertising platform for mobile-applications developers, a push by the largest Web retailer to grab a bigger piece of the smartphone advertising market dominated by Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. The service lets developers promote their apps on Android smartphones and tablets as well as Amazon tablets, paying Amazon each time a user clicks an advertisement displayed through the system. Campaigns start at $100. Amazon is a small player in the $28.7 billion U.S. mobile-advertising industry. The Seattle-based company has less than a 1 percent share of the market, compared with Google s 35 percent and Facebook s 17 percent, according to EMarketer Inc. Spending to market apps alone is projected to rise 80 percent this year to $3 billion, with Facebook leading that category.
