Amazon Announces Purchase of Video-Software Company Elemental: Amazon is buying Elemental Technologies, a provider of technology for distributing videos to Web-connected devices, seeking to expand its portfolio of cloud-computing services. The online retailer paid about $500 million for Elemental, which helps media and entertainment providers reformat video made for cable, satellite and airwaves broadcast so that clips can be transmitted to desktop computers, smartphones and tablets. Amazon described the acquisition as a way to bring more video capabilities to Amazon Web Services, its Internet computing business. The Web retailer also offers movies and TV shows, which may also benefit from Elemental s technology. Elemental has more than 700 media customers and supports over-the-top TV applications such as BBC s iPlayer, CNNGo and ESPN ScoreCenter, and will continue to operate under its existing brand.
