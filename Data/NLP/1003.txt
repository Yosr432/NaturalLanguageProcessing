Apple s iPhone Grows Finally Flatlines: 0.4% Yearly With 75 Million Units Sold In Q1: Apple today reported sales of 74.8 million iPhones, 16.1 million iPads, and 5.3 million Macs in its Q1 earnings report today. Apple s first quarter includes holiday sales, as the three-month period ends December 31, 2015. As such, it was supposed to be one of Cupertino s best qrters of the year. Plus, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus both went live on September 25, meaning that Apple s next-gen flagship devices were available for the whole of this quarter. Last year at the same time, Apple sold nearly 75 million units of the iPhone, which represented 57 percent revenue growth from the year before. This quarter s sales of 74.8 million iPhones puts yearly revenue growth at just one percent for the category, and device sale growth at 0.4 percent. In terms of quarterly growth, Apple sold 56 percent more iPhones from last quarter s 48 million. Apple was expected to sell at least 75 million units of the iPhone this year, a forecast that analysts have had a very close eye on during the course of the quarter. Many fear that the iPhone may finally start declining after nearly eight solid years of growth. On the other side of the spectrum, Apple is having more difficulty cultivating the iPad line of products. The company sold 16.1 million iPads in the first quarter, down 25 percent year-over-year, but up 63 percent from last quarter. Meanwhile, the PC industry as a whole has been steadily slowing, and Apple is no exception. Apple sold 5.3 million units of the Mac, down four percent from last year.
