A Gushing Review for Windows 10: "I used to doubt Microsoft. Then I installed Windows 10": I don t know if I broke a law of computing or committed heresy. But I installed Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. I had feared that this would condemn me to purgatory in the gates of computing hell. But it has been an incredibly positive experience: my favorite Microsoft Office applications   Outlook, Word, and PowerPoint   work faster than ever before, and I can still use Apple peripherals   a Thunderbolt Display and Thunderbolt external hard drives. The best part is Windows 10 itself: it is a beautifully designed operating system that gives me the best of the past and present   maintaining the usability and familiarity of the old Windows operating system, and letting me download slick apps designed for tablets. Another Microsoft product that I had written off years ago is Microsoft s Internet Explorer. The jury is still out, but Microsoft s new browser, Edge, seems faster than Google s Chrome. I may end up switching browsers as well. What is clear is that Microsoft is back   in full force. This is a good thing; Apple and Google desperately need the competition that Microsoft will once again provide.
