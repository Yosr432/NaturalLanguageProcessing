Grand Theft Auto' publisher Take-Two's revenue jumps 13 percent: Videogame publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc reported a 13 percent rise in revenue, helped by strong sales of its "Grand Theft Auto V" and "NBA 2K16" titles. Take-Two, like its rivals, has also benefited from a shift by players downloading digital copies of its videogames   which generate higher margins   rather than buying physical game discs. Take Two's net revenue rose to $311.55 million in the first quarter ended June 30 from $257.30 million a year earlier. Digital downloads accounted for about 55 percent of revenue in the quarter. Net loss narrowed to $38.57 million, or 46 cents per share, from $67.02 million, or 81 cents per share.
