"Create-to-consume" (aka "Reply to unlock") failed, so Facebook relaunches Slingshot with easier Discovery; to be (even) more like Snapchat: Facebook first launched Slingshot back in June with an innovative, if a bit friction-full, feature where you had to reply with a photo or video to see one a friend had sent you. It was one of the early releases from Facebook s Creative Labs project for experimenting with mobile app design. While I found it fun at first, the annoyance of having to create to consume eventually whittled down the small initial user base, and I haven t received a Sling in months. The update in September that dropped the reply-to-unlock requirement did nothing to reinvigorate the community.Today Facebook took yet another swipe at Snapchat with the re-release of its ephemeral sharing app Slingshot for iOS and Android. Now you follow people like on Twitter, but you can still privately message. If you pull down the camera, you ll see a grid of shots from the last 24 hours by people you follow   a lot like Snapchat Stories. The difference is you can immediately see big visual previews of friends  Slings rather than having to open them to reveal what they ve been up to like on Snapchat. And spying the success of Snapchat Stories stars, Slingshot has a discovery center for finding cool people to follow.
