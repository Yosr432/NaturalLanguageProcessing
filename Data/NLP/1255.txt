Alibaba, Baidu Turn `Kingmakers' as China Sees Dealmaking Surge: To understand why China is in the midst of a surge in dealmaking and why that won t slow down anytime soon, consider the arranged marriage of two of the country s largest travel websites. Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. and Ctrip.com International Ltd. were bitter rivals for years, bickering in public and sacrificing profits to grab customers in the growing China market. Then Qunar s largest shareholder, Baidu Inc., forced it into a deal that gave Ctrip control over the combined entity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Qunar s management learned their fate only two days before the announcement, the person said. China s Internet market, after a surge in startups and record venture-capital investments, is entering a new phase of consolidation as investors grow weary of money-losing battles for customers and push for profitability. Acquisitions by Chinese companies rose 75 percent this year to $413.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with domestic deals in the Internet industry nearly quadrupling to $55.6 billion.
