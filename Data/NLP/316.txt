Snapchat, Known for Ephemera, Proves Its Staying Power With Videos:  Snapchat is the company that will figure out how to move TV viewers to mobile,  said Hemant Taneja, a Snapchat investor and managing director at the venture firm General Catalyst Partners.  YouTube and others have worked hard to bring video to mobile devices, but Snapchat is the first to crack how users behave on mobile.  Since introducing Discover in January 2015, Snapchat has become a web of highly edited video content   whether made by users, celebrities or media companies like Buzzfeed and CNN. That, in turn, has caught the attention of advertisers who want to reach Snapchat s growing audience, which, the company says, includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34. By comparison, the company says that the average television network in the United States reaches about 6 percent of the same demographic. Now, Snapchat is preparing to deliver more original programming. Popular NBC shows including  Saturday Night Live  and  The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon  have agreed to create programming for Snapchat, and  The Voice  ran a five-part series made just for the app. E News now has a weekly Snapchat-only pop-culture program called  The Rundown.  Television ad dollars would  flood into online  if online ads could prove they were as effective as television ads, said Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group. For Mr. Marchese, that means the ad takes up the full screen, probably plays with the sound on and is viewed in its entirety. While advertisers do not go so far as to say that Snapchat video ads are equivalent to television ads, they note that watching content on Snapchat mimics, in some crucial ways, the experience of watching traditional television. Videos play with the sound on. They take up the full screen. They tell a narrative story. Users flip between them like they do TV channels.
