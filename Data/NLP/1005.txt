Software maker VMware to cut 800 jobs, sees weak 2016: VMware Inc forecast 2016 revenue and profit below analysts' expectations, suggesting the software maker's strong growth in new businesses was not enough to compensate for weakness in its traditional server-virtualization software. VMWare, like many technology providers, is struggling to keep pace with its customers' efforts to move key computing infrastructure to the cloud, meaning remote data centers. VMware shares fell 5 percent in extended trading on Tuesday, while EMC shares declined 1.4 percent. The company, whose flagship product helps customers cut costs by running multiple operating systems on a single server, has been hurt by slowing economic growth in markets outside the United States, which account for nearly half of its revenue. In particular, it cited weak bookings for its software in China, Russia, and Brazil. But the company noted some bright spots in newer businesses, such as NSX, which makes networking more efficient. That business is on track to generate $600 million annually, VMWare said, up from $200 million a year ago. The company's net income rose 14.4 percent to $373 million, or 88 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helped by a 12.6 percent jump in its services revenue. Revenue increased 9.7 percent to $1.87 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.85 billion.
