Google Tests Price Comparison Within Product Listing Ads To Compete with Amazon, Jet: Google is testing a new Product Listing Ad format that informs shoppers of their percentage savings within a PLA. In the examples that our digital marketing experts uncovered, Google states about the product,  Price is X% lower than average online prices.  At first glance, it looks like this could be an extension of the  Value Alert  feature covered earlier this year in Search Engine Land. Where Google pulls the data to find the average online price has not yet been disclosed. However, based on some quick calculations for a  KitchenAid Mixer  (showing as 14% off in the image below), for the 47 listed on Google Shopping the price was 13.9% off inclusive of shipping but exclusive of tax. This makes sense because tax would vary based upon your location. This suggests that Google is using all of the models that are listed on Google Shopping, as opposed to just the subset featured in the Product Listing Ad. Channel Advisor, which first reported this, theorizes the experiment could have come about because larger marketplaces like Amazon, and potentially newcomer Jet.com, have the potential to continue to eat away at Google s business. That is, instead of turning to Google s search engine to locate products, consumers just go directly to Amazon s website to find low-priced items.
