YouTube's Top Advertisers Increased Their Spending by 60% in Q2: Google's second quarter earnings report today, the tech giant revealed that YouTube viewership is growing faster than it has in two years, and advertiser money is following. YouTube's mobile users averaged 40 minutes per session during Q2, which represents a 50 percent increase year over year while ultimately helping the Mountain View, Calif.-based player beat Wall Street expectations. The number of advertisers rose 40 percent year over year on the video platform, while the average spend of YouTube's top 100 advertisers rose 60 percent. Google does not break out how much revenue YouTube generates, but executives were clearly satisfied with the performance. There are more 18- to-49-year-olds on YouTube than there are consumers who watch cable TV, Porat said.
