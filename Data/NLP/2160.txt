With Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, Samsung Tries to Regain Its Footing: Samsung s internal code name for its latest top-of-the-line smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, is  Project Zero,  signaling what Samsung calls  a return to fundamentals.  The code name also suggests that Samsung finally seems to understand the many criticisms that have long been leveled at its phones: the plastic hardware looked cheap, the most promoted features were mostly useless and the software was too complicated. Samsung, according to Samsung, has realized the errors of it ways. The realization was born out of necessity. Samsung s market share and profits in the smartphone business have plummeted over the last year. The company, which is based in South Korea, is in the unenviable position of getting squeezed from the bottom by the affordable phones made by Chinese upstarts like Xiaomi and at the top by Apple s powerhouse line of iPhones. The elegant new Galaxy phones, which went on sale in the United States last week, are aiming to pull Samsung out of that pickle. But while the phones are magnificent to look at, they are most likely not quite enough to fix what ails the company. Despite improved hardware, the S6 and S6 Edge still lack compelling software. Unlike Apple, Samsung has never managed to create a built-in suite of software and services to keep people hooked to its own phones. And there are few obvious ways for Samsung to address this glaring flaw.  You can argue that they re in phase one of fixing their software, which is getting rid of a lot of the junk,  said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst who anticipated Samsung s recent troubles.  But we haven t really seen phase two, which would be building its own stuff. We haven t really seen much of that so far.
