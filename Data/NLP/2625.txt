Xiaomi Confirms It Has Suspended Sales In India,  open to working with Ericsson to resolve this matter amicably : Hugo Barra revealed the temporary pause in India, which is triggered by a patent suit brought against the company by Ericsson, via an update on Google+. Initially, Xiaomi told media it had not received a notice from the high court, but that situation has changed now. Xiaomi told TechCrunch yesterday that it is  open to working with Ericsson to resolve this matter amicably  so this situation may yet be remedied quickly and without too much disruption to its sales in India. Indeed, Ericsson has struck recent patent deals with a number of India-based phone makers, and it may be holding out for a similar arrangement with Xiaomi.
