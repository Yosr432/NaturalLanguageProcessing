EBay Revamps Seller-Rating System in Appeal to Merchants: EBay is overhauling its ratings system so that sellers aren t penalized for late shipments beyond their control or for routine returns and exchanges, seeking to boost sales as an independent company. While the online marketplace has long relied on a five-star rating system and commentaries that lets merchants and buyers grade each other on transactions, sellers have long complained that these also make them vulnerable to customer angst over minor issues that are unavoidable or easily resolved. EBay s seller rankings can make or break the merchants selling everything from sweaters to smartphones, because they influence how prominently products appear in search results and the likelihood that shoppers will conduct business with them. EBay is stepping up efforts to keep its sellers happy, following its split in July from the PayPal Holdings Inc. transactions business. "Our relationship with our sellers needs to be improved," Jordan Sweetnam, EBay s vice president of seller experience, said in an interview. "These are the biggest changes we ve made in years." The new rating system is more simple and objective, according to Sweetnam. Sellers won t be penalized for late deliveries as long as they get orders to couriers on time, while returns or exchanges won t affect ratings if they re resolved and the customer is satisfied with the process.
