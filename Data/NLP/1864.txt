Geek shortage stymies Israel's Tech Boom as Soviet emigre engineers retire, fewer youth study advanced science. Israel's technology miracle is threatened by a dearth of people in the very professions that made it happen: engineers and computer scientists. Companies say finding qualified workers is one of their biggest problems. And the shortage may worsen as fewer students sign up for the most advanced math classes, the building block for tech careers. This in an economy whose health depends on exports about one-third of them from technology companies. One explanation for the shortage: Engineers who emigrated from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s are retiring. "We don't truly appreciate that immigration,'' says Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. "Without that I'm not sure we would be 'Start-Up Nation'.Meanwhile, fewer of Israel's youth are choosing to study advanced math, and there's no increase in those studying advanced science, in part put off by the level of difficulty that could bring down overall grades. The number of high school students matriculating in advanced math dropped by a quarter from 2006, to 9,350 in 2014, according to the Trump Foundation, dedicated to improving education in Israel. Almost a year ago, a ministerial committee drew up a program to increase skilled manpower for the industry. Its plan includes recruiting more Israeli Arabs into the industry, training ultra-Orthodox men and women, luring Israeli engineers abroad to return home, and making it easier for non-Israelis to get work visas. It must be approved by the new cabinet and could be passed later this year. Some parts are in place: About 300 academics were persuaded to return to Israel last year out of 4,300 who registered as willing to do so.
