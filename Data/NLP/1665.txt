Apple Profit Up 38%, but iPhone Sales Disappoint Wall Street: Apple reported double-digit increases in sales and profit for its fiscal third quarter, a rate of growth that is highly unusual for a company of its size. Yet the results still fell short of estimates by Wall Street analysts, who are accustomed to Apple blowing past projections and had been predicting sky-high sales of iPhones and the company s brand-new Apple Watch. In total, Apple reported a 38 percent increase in profit, to $10.7 billion, from a year ago, with revenue surging 33 percent to $49.6 billion. Sales of the company s biggest revenue and profit generator, the iPhone, soared 35 percent to 47.5 million units. IPhone sales faced some tough sequential comparisons. The 47.5 million units sold in the quarter was below the roughly 50 million that analysts had calculated Apple would sell, and was also down from the 40 percent growth in the previous quarter and the 46 percent growth two quarters earlier. Still, the rate of growth exceeded the 13 percent increase in the same period a year ago. And while Apple did not share numbers on sales of the Apple Watch, which began selling in April, analysts on Tuesday calculated that the company had sold between 1.5 million and three million watches, far less than the three million to five million watches they had predicted ahead of Apple s earnings report. Apple s sales in the quarter were fueled by overseas buyers, with international regions accounting for 64 percent of the quarter s overall revenue. Sales in the greater China region, one of Apple s prime growth areas, more than doubled to $13.2 billion. The company also reported healthy growth for its Macintosh computer business. Apple sold 4.8 million Macs, up 9 percent from a year ago. Shares were down 7% in after-hours trading.
