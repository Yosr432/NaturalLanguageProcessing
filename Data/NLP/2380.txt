The move is seen as Alibaba's effort to kickstart its struggling mobile phone division: Alibaba is stumping up more than half a billion dollars to kick its lacklustre mobile phone business into gear. The NYSE-listed e-commerce giant today announced a $590 million investment in Chinese phone-maker Meizu. The deal grants Alibaba an undisclosed  minority  share in the Guangdong-based company, which sold 1.5 million of its Android-based smartphones in January, but it is particularly notable for the strategic alliance between the two. Meizu, which operates a Xiaomi-like online sales model but is yet to break into China s top five smartphone companies based on sales, will integrate its hardware with Alibaba s struggling operating system. Aliyun, which is based around Android, is used for smartphones and smart TV sets. The move is an interesting one when you consider that Xiaomi, the smartphone success story of 2014, is rapidly moving into e-commerce after starting out in mobile hardware and software.
