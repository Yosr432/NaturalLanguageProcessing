Facebook just bought a small hardware startup called Nascent Objects: Facebook has acquired Nascent Objects, a small Bay Area startup that offers what the company calls a  modular electronics platform    essentially a software program to help expedite the process for building physical gadgets, including 3-D-printed hardware. Nascent Objects will join Facebook s Building 8, the company s new top-secret hardware lab run byformer Xoogler Regina Dugan, who used to run Google s advanced technology and products team that did things like 3-D mapping and modular smartphones.he  modular  element is interesting. The idea of a modular smartphone where you can easily add or remove different components like a camera or battery or storage has been kicked around for a while now but has never taken off. It s unclear what Facebook wants to build, but Nascent Objects specializes in modular gadgets. The other key seems to be expediting the time it takes to prototype hardware projects, which is also why Facebook recently built a new hardware lab on its Menlo Park, Calif., campus.
