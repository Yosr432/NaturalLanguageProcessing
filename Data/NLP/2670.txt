Using mobile apps to interact with toys:  We want to draw kids out of a two-dimensional screen, to blend a hands-on physical experience with an app, and make something new come to life,  said Vikas Gupta, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wonder Workshop, a start-up that makes Dash and Dot, two programmable toy robots that will begin shipping to early backers this holiday season. Dash and Dot are controlled by a mobile app, but they can also be taught to understand and react to events that happen in the real world   to play a real tune on a xylophone, say, or to bark in response to a child s clap. Wonder Workshop is on the vanguard of a trend that threatens to overrun much of the traditional, mass-manufactured toy business.
