Fading Monster.com hopes big-data snooping and audience targeting will win its mojo back: Monster.com disrupted the talent business, and then the disrupter was itself disrupted. Competing websites, as well as aggregators that scanned many sites for job listings and put them in one place, began to eat into Monster s business. LinkedIn was born and became a global behemoth by positioning itself as an upscale matchmaker that helped people build careers, not just find the next job. Today, the company that owns Monster.com, renamed Monster Worldwide, is a shadow of its former self, and its stock trades for less than $4 a share. It still earns substantial revenue, $194.4 million in the second quarter of this year, from its job board and various other services. But now it wants to recapture some of its past luster by offering new cutting-edge tools for employers. Its latest products, both rooted in start-ups acquired by Monster this year, use big-data snooping and social-ad targeting to improve the process of matching job openings and potential applicants. The more developed of the two new tools, called TalentBin, works by building profiles of individual workers. But unlike LinkedIn, it does so without their active participation or consent. Instead, TalentBin scans publicly posted information on social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Meetup and Twitter, as well as what people have put on industry-specific sites, such as GitHub for software engineers and Dribbble for visual designers, to craft the dossiers. It then allows employers to run their job listings against the database to find people who meet certain criteria, such as  knows a lot about Java programming.  Recruiters can also study the dossiers to craft personalized email pitches to top candidates, citing personal or professional details from their profiles   something like  I loved the shoe designs you posted on Coroflot.
