Alibaba Falls as Sales Volume Slows, Adding to China Concern: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shares fell after the Chinese online retailer reported flagging growth in sales on its marketplaces, adding to concerns about the country s economic slowdown. The shares dropped 3.8 percent to $66.92 in New York, bringing their loss for the year to 18 percent. While gross merchandise volume on Alibaba s Chinese retail marketplaces rose 22 percent to 964 billion yuan ($147 billion) in the three months ended December 31, that s less than the 28 percent increase in the prior quarter.  Revenue and earnings per share beat analysts  estimates in the fourth quarter because Alibaba was able to sell more ads to its merchants and better capitalize on its Tmall and Taobao platforms, he said. What s troubling is the decelerated growth in GMV, most worryingly at Tmall, where it was 37 percent this quarter, compared with 56 percent growth the previous period, Cordwell said. Plus, the boost in sales from advertising came from Alibaba catching up on monetizing its mobile platforms, a phenomenon that will end, he said. Sales of 34.5 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) rose 32%, and outpaced expectations for a 27-percent rise. The proportion of revenue Alibaba gets from outside China fell to 6 percent
