With a Mobile Website Like an App, Flipkart Takes a Swipe at Apple: India s e-commerce start-up Flipkart has worked with Google to make a new mobile website that could eliminate the need for apps, in a move that takes a swipe at Apple s grip on the mobile experience. On Monday, Flipkart unveiled the website, which it created with the Google team that focuses on the mobile web browser Chrome. The two made a site that supports push notifications, the ability to search for and read information while offline, location-based data and access to hardware features like a smartphone s camera. While such features have long been available in apps that people download to their phones, they typically have not been prevalent on mobile websites. Flipkart plans to show other companies what it took to build the website   including the hurdles it had to overcome and the weaknesses it found   at Google s Chrome Developers Conference this month. Google s parent company is Alphabet.
