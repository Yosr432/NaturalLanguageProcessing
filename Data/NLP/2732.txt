Amazon is experimenting with (i) deliveries by taxi in the US, and (ii) tying up with newspaper vendors as pick-up locations at scale in the UK: US Taxi-Delivery Experiment: Amazon.com Inc is testing deliveries via taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, according to the Wall Street Journal, as the Internet retailer explores alternative modes of delivery to speed up shipments while restraining cost. Amazon is using the taxi-hailing mobile app, Flywheel, to ship parcels via licensed cabs, studying the feasibility of using taxi fleets more broadly as a delivery avenue, the Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying. In its latest test, Amazon summoned cabs through Flywheel to distribution centers, from where they picked up as many as 10 packages bound for the same location at about $5 per package, the Journal reported. The deliveries usually took place early in the morning, when taxi traffic was low and the competition unlikely to notice, the paper cited the people as saying. UK Tie-up with news wholesaler for in-store pick-up: In October 2014, Amazon announced a partnership with Smiths News, a leading UK newspaper and magazine wholesaler, to offer customers same-day pickup service via the newsagent s new subsidiary, Pass My Parcel, which will deliver Amazon packages to its select retail locations. Pickup locations are available in more than 6,000 locations throughout the UK, but same-day service is available for only 500 of them. During online checkout, buyers may see a "Pickup is Available   Choose from XX Locations Near You  message, which lets them select a delivery and pickup site. With the Pass My Parcel delivery service, the delivery process is expedited through Smiths News  twice-daily distribution schedule. Orders made by 11:45 a.m. can be available for same-day pickup at 4 p.m., and orders made by 7:45 p.m. can be available for pickup by 6:30 the next morning in these select retail locations.
