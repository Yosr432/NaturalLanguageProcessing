Etsy Plunges 13% After Reporting Its First-Quarter Financial Performance: Shares of Etsy ,the online marketplace for handmade goods which IPO-ed in April, plunged today after the company reported roughly in-line revenue and a wider-than-expected loss. Etsy, a popular marketplace for handmade goods, reported top line of $58.5 million, ahead of expectations of $58 million. However, the company lost $36.6 million in the quarter, or $0.84 per share. In the year-ago quarter, Etsy had a far-smaller $463,000 loss. Etsy is off over 13 percent in after-hours trading as of the time of writing. The company s revenue growth, compared to the year-ago quarter of 44.4 percent, greatly outpaces the expansion of sales on its platform, which posted a slimmer 28.2 percent rise. Investors may view that discrepancy as indicative of potentially deprecated revenue growth. Adding to the negative pressure is the company s notes on its second   i.e. current   quarter, which indicated lower revenue growth, increased headcount and rising costs. Combined, you can spell that in the following way: margin pressure. Etsy s operating expenses rose 72.6 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
