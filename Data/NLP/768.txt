Samsung Beats Estimates as Early Debut of S7 Boosts Sales:  Samsung Electronics Co. posted a better-than expected first-quarter profit after the early release of Galaxy S7 smartphones gave it a head-start on Apple Inc. and Chinese rivals and helped counter an industry downturn. Operating income rose to 6.6 trillion won ($5.7 billion) in the three months ended March, the world s largest maker of phones and memory chips said in preliminary results released Thursday. That compares with the 5.53 trillion-won average of analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Samsung debuted its high-end smartphones in March, about a month earlier than last year s, with sales of the S7 line-up estimated to have hit 9 million units during their first month -- triple those of the S6 in the same time-frame. Production of curved displays for its Edge version also went more smoothly this time, avoiding the hiccups that plagued last year s wraparound-screen line.  The biggest reason for the sharply improved profitability is largely due to much lower marketing spending for the mobile business,  said Yoo Eui Hyung, an analyst at Dongbu Securities Co. in Seoul.  The big disparity between the earlier profit estimates and the latest revisions stems entirely from the mobile business. The faster release surely helped but it s dubious whether the S7 can continue to surprise the market in the longer run.
