TVF and AIB, Stars of India s Online Video Scene Struggle to Make a Living: It s not just the streaming video services that are struggling to make a profit in India. Even the country s most popular YouTube stars have trouble making a living from digital video. The Viral Fever, a troupe of actors that creates TV-style episodic comedies, has one of the country s most popular channels on YouTube, with about 1.3 million subscribers. Its most recent series,  Pitchers,  focused on a group of young tech workers trying to decide whether to form their own start-up. But the ad revenue from YouTube is so low that the group, known as T.V.F., has turned to sponsors like Kingfisher beer and Pond s cold cream for funding to create its shows. T.V.F. also makes corporate videos and does live comedy shows at Indian colleges to help pay the bills. All India Bakchod, a four-man comedy troupe, has had similar challenges. The group has produced videos making fun of topics like Bollywood, Indian weddings and politics and has nearly 1.5 million followers on its YouTube channel. About two months ago, A.I.B. finally hit the big time, when Star India, a group of television channels owned by 21st Century Fox, began airing a weekly news satire show starring the group on its Hotstar app and on TV. Mr. Joshi said that A.I.B. essentially breaks even on video production costs and makes extra income from branded content it creates for Red Bull, Xbox and Quiksilver.
