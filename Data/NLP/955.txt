Federal Government Will Treat Google s Driverless Car System as a Legal Driver: Google s robot just got its driver s license. On Tuesday, the federal agency that sets road rules   the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)   released a letter to the Internet giant that supports its interpretation of a driverless system as legally adequate for roadways, a key victory for the critical initiative within Alphabet, Google s parent company. Previously, the NHTSA only considered humans as drivers under law, because that s how cars worked until Google came along. Now the agency has said it will consider Google s self-driving system a driver, too. The letter came in response to a November petition from Chris Urmson, the director of Google s self-driving car project. Urmson argued that regulators should treat Google s homemade cars, built without a steering wheel and brakes, on par with human drivers. It s been a persistent sticking point for the Google unit, particularly after California issued draft autonomous vehicle rules expressly prohibiting driverless cars. Ensuring that its driverless fleet has regulatory approval to get on the roads is critical to Google s car strategy.
