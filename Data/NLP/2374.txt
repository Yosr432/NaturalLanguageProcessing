The package delivery start-up space is getting increasingly crowded in the US: Sidecar, a Ride-Hailing Start-Up, Pushes Into Package Delivery Start-ups like Uber and Lyft are making it acceptable to carpool with total strangers. In the future, you may start carpooling with their lunch. That is exactly what Sidecar, a ride-hailing start-up in competition with the likes of Uber and Lyft, aims to make happen. The company announced on Monday it plans to use its fleet of cars to introduce a package delivery service, delivering items like food and groceries for partner companies. That service will be powered by Sidecar drivers who are also picking up and dropping off passengers, a move the company says cuts pricing and delivery times dramatically. The new service, which is now available in all of the American cities in which Sidecar operates, is essentially an open call to restaurants, grocers and stores which do not otherwise offer a delivery service. Sidecar, which is based in San Francisco, will face numerous competitors. GrubHub, the big online food-ordering service, recently acquired DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run, two companies that will allow GrubHub to start offering delivery for the restaurants it serves. Postmates, another start-up, owns a fleet of messengers who order and pick up food from thousands of restaurants. Sidecar will rub up against Uber, too, in its ultimate ambitions of becoming a way to delivery anything   from groceries to gourmet food   anytime, anywhere to anyone. And to some degree, Sidecar s move into deliver will also pit it against a couple of the tech titans, Amazon and Google, which have both dabbled in same-day delivery projects.
