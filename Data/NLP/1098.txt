Cisco reviews code after Juniper code backdoor found; more scrutiny expected: Networking equipment maker Cisco said on Monday it has launched a product review to look for tampering after rival Juniper Networks's disclosure found code in firewall software that made it vulnerable to cyber attacks. Juniper warned customers on Thursday that it had uncovered "unauthorized code" in its firewall software, saying it could be exploited to allow an attacker to unscramble encrypted communications that travel through the security devices. That prompted the code review by Cisco. Security experts said they expect other technology companies to conduct similar investigations after last week's unprecedented news from Juniper. It was the first time a major technology firm discovered the addition of an unauthorized 'back door," or code that could be exploited to facilitate cyber attacks, according to security experts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating how the Juniper "back door" might impact government networks.
