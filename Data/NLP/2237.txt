YouTube embraces 360-degree videos, signaling the next trend in video: Friday YouTube announced it now supports 360-degree video uploads, marking a significant step toward the video format going mainstream. Currently these YouTube videos can only be viewed on Google Chrome and in YouTube s Android app. YouTube says it s working on compatibility for iOS devices and other Web browsers. The videos are a step toward virtual reality, offering an 2D-immersive experience in which a user can pan around a video with their mouse. It s similar to the experience of Google Maps  Street View function, except with video not photos. Viewers will no longer be locked to a fixed perspective. For now, uploaders of 360-degree videos will need to run a script on their video to add metadata so YouTube recognizes it as a 360-degree video. YouTube is working to automate this step. The viewing experience is especially neat for an Android user in the YouTube app. If you move your phone from side to side, the perspective will shift. Makers of 360-degree cameras expect these videos to soon be ubiquitous.  Similar to Flip driving the popularity of YouTube video and the idea of sharing, 360-degree cameras and technology take video as we know it to the next level,  said Paul Meyhoefer, vice president of marketing at JK Imaging Ltd, maker of the Kodak SP360. YouTube will support uploads from 360-cameras such as the Bublcam, IC Real Tech s Allie, Kodak s SP360 and the Ricoh Theta. The cameras are fairly expensive   ranging from about $300 to $700, but they should become cheaper in time.
