Amazon starts Sunday delivery service in India: Global e-commerce giant Amazon has expanded the scope of its logistics services and is now delivering products on Sundays starting with 100 cities of the country, it said. It s key competitor Flipkart among others already deliver products on Sundays so Amazon s move is more a catch-up rather than an industry-first initiative. Amazon has already been doing same day, next day, two day and release (or launch) day delivery options for products. However, if consumers ordered the product on a Friday (two-day delivery option) or Saturday (one day delivery option) their deliveries was still rolled over to Monday as the firm was not delivering on Sundays. This changes now. Currently, Amazon has over 700,000 products available for next day delivery across eligible pin codes in several cities and around 75 per cent customer demand is already eligible for next-day shipping on products fulfilled by Amazon.
