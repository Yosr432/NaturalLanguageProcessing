Zomato rolls out online ordering of food in updated app, to allow cash-less payments at restaurants: Zomato.com, has entered the online ordering space as a mobile-only offering. Its updated version of mobile app comes integrated with a meal ordering option. The service has gone live with 1,000 restaurants currently and users can look for those outlets offering the option within the  Nearby  tab in the app. It then throws up those names which offer online ordering as a sub-set of the overall list of restaurants in the location. We have not checked the process throughout but it involves a mobile verification while placing the order. The users would have to make cash payments as restaurant delivery boys come with the package. The updated app also shows an option of cashless payments which is not active yet. Zomato spokesperson told Techcircle.in that this option is currently active only in Dubai and will soon be launched in India. This would allow users to pay after a meal at a partner restaurant through the Zomato app, instead of paying cash or using credit/debit cards to settle bills at the restaurants.
