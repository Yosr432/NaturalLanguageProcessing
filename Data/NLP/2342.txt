Ford and Tencent in talks to build messaging functions for Ford's cars in China: Ford said it was in talks with Tencent, maker of the popular WeChat messaging app, to develop messaging functions for the manufacturer s cars in China. David Huang, a senior engineer who heads Ford s Asia Pacific connected-services unit, said,  People want to stay connected, stay informed and stay entertained all the time, even when they re driving.  Drivers would sync their phone to their car s software system and control WeChat functions, chosen by Tencent and certified by Ford as safe, through voice commands or limited use of buttons. Yale Zhang, managing director of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said connectivity was a deciding factor for Chinese customers buying a car.  Those kind of things are the fundamental things people will consider,  he added. Many Chinese use WeChat s free voice messaging feature instead of phone calls, holding up their smartphones like walkie-talkies as they speak, tap and listen to replies. Rivals including Daimler and Nissan are also looking at ways to give drivers safe, hands-free access to mobile apps in China, home to the world s largest number of smartphone users. WeChat is China s most prevalent chatting app, with about half a billion active monthly users.
