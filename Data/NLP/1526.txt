On Friday, US Stocks Fell Most in 4 Years as China Dread Sank Global Markets: Turbulence in financial markets gathered momentum amid intensifying concern over slowing global growth, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a correction and giving other stock gauges their worst losses since 2011. Oil sank below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009 and was set for its longest losing streak since 1986. More than $3.3 trillion has been erased from the value of global equities after China s decision to devalue its currency spurred a wave of selling across emerging markets. The worries over slower economic growth come as a strong dollar and plunge in oil prices take a toll on corporate earnings at the same time the Federal Reserve is contemplating the first boost to interest rates since 2006. Investors are selling the biggest winners of 2015. Companies that have come to be known as the Fab Five -- Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple --have seen $97 billion in market value erased over two days. Losses have pushed the Nasdaq 100 Index down 7 percent, the biggest two-day decline since 2008. Apple entered a bear market, dropping 20 percent from a February high.
