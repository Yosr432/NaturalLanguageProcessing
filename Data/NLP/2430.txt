Facebook ad targeting has led to spectacular monetization improvements in the US and Europe: Facebook s been a quest to improve its ad measurement, and it s definitely paying off. In Q4 2014, Facebook s user count in the US & Canada only grew by a tiny 0.97% from 204 million to 206 million, but the average ad revenue it earns from each of those users grew 24% from $6.64 to $8.26. It means that through better ad targeting to connect customers to the brands they re likely to buy from, and improved online and offline sales measurement to track those purchases, it s been able to grow ad revenue about 25X faster than user count. That s not just in North America. In Europe, average ad revenue per user was up 21% on just 1.3% user growth. Now the question is whether can figure out how to do the same in the developing world. In the  Rest Of World  region that includes many developing nations in Africa and South America, user count grew 3% from 423 million to 436 million users, yet average ad revenue per user there only grew 12% from $0.82 to $0.92. That s strong, but not like it is in the US and Canada.
