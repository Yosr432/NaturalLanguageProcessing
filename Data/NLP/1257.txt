Gmail s Inbox app will now write (some of) your e-mails for you: Google just gave a little bit of help to anyone tired of typing out the same reply to e-mails over and over again. Now, software will do some of the work for you. An updated version of Inbox, one of Google's mail apps, will "read" your e-mails and offer up suggested replies. In a company blog post, Gmail software engineer B lint Mikl s said Tuesday that the feature "uses machine learning to recognize emails that need responses and to generate the natural language responses on the fly." The goal is to have options good enough that a user will send short messages in just two taps. And the suggestions are designed to get better as you use the feature more often, and Inbox learns your personal quirks.
