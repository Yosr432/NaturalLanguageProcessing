Slew of Developer-Focused Announcements from Amazon, Including  Amazon Fling,  A Developer Toolkit For Sending Media From Mobile Apps To Fire TV: Amid a slew of developer-focused announcements from Amazon today focused on things like using AWS for app testing, and the arrival of a new API Gateway service, for example, the company also introduced the new  Amazon Fling  service. Available as an SDK for iOS and Android applications, Amazon Fling allows developers to build apps that can send media content to Amazon s Fire TV as well as work as  second screen  or companion apps to what s already running on Fire TV.  Flinging,  which is basically Amazon s own version of Chromecast s  casting,  lets a mobile app maker send a video, audio or images from their iOS or Android app to a user s big screen TV by way of the Amazon Fire TV media player. It does this by simplifying the underlying network discovery and communication technologies that would otherwise be difficult to implement, the company explains. With Amazon Fling, Amazon made a point to appeal to developers who are already leveraging Chromecast functionality in their apps by making it possible to integrate the new Amazon SDK with an existing Android or iOS Chromecast app. To simplify the process, the company released developer documentation that explains how to modify an existing app that s using the Google Cast Companion Library to also support Amazon Fling. Developers who have already built an Amazon Fire TV app can use the SDK to both control their app, if it s already installed, or remotely install it if not. For developers without an Amazon Fire TV app, they re able to use the Amazon Fire TV media player instead.
