Facebook weighs a "Dislike" button: Facebook s famous  like  button, with its silhouette of an upturned thumb, will soon be accompanied by an alternative: a way to  dislike  a post. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company s co-founder and chief executive, said that Facebook was  very close to shipping a test  of a dislike button. He suggested that the new button would probably be more nuanced than a simple thumbs-down option. His comments nevertheless raised the possibility that Facebook, the world s largest forum for self-expression, could soon become a less friendly place. The prospect of a new dislike button has been polarizing among Facebook users. As for Facebook s business   selling ads   a dislike button could cut both ways. It could increase the level of engagement that people have with posts, and therefore the number of ads they eventually see. But a dislike button could also be disconcerting to marketers, who prefer their messages to be surrounded by happy emotions. Over all, it s probably a good thing to enable people to express feelings and emotions that they can t express through a like button,  Ms. Williamson said.  But Facebook needs to be careful as to how they enable that capability with regard to advertising and all the potentially inflammatory discussions that could occur online.  Mr. Zuckerberg clearly has such concerns in mind. He stressed that Facebook would test the new button before introducing it broadly, and refine it based on user feedback.  Hopefully we ll deliver something that meets the needs of our community,  he said. Facebook s decision to experiment with a new button came after much deliberation. In December, Mr. Zuckerberg told a similar meeting of users that the company had been working on the idea but had not figured out how to add a dislike button  so that it ends up being a force for good and not a force for bad.
