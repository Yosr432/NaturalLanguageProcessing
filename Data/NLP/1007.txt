SoftBank's Slide Leaves It Worth Less Than Stake in Alibaba: SoftBank tumbled below the value of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. amid growing concerns about the Japanese company s other assets, including struggling U.S. wireless carrier Sprint. SoftBank s market capitalization stood at 5.89 trillion yen ($50 billion) Friday after its stock rebounded 8 percent after a four-day losing streak triggered by rising pessimism about Sprint s ability to pay down debt. That still lags the $56 billion that its stake in Alibaba is worth, according to its own website.  Billionaire Masayoshi Son has struggled to turn around Sprint since buying a controlling stake in 2013 for SoftBank s biggest acquisition ever. The wireless operator lost its place as the third-largest U.S. carrier to T-Mobile US Inc. and its stock this week fell to the lowest level in more than two years. Its bonds led declines among junk-rated debt Wednesday.  It s symbolic because it tells you that investors feel SoftBank has been destroying value,  said Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore.  Son s pride has been another major issue, which pushed him to where he is now.  SoftBank lists the value of holdings in nine other public companies on its website, including Sprint and Yahoo Japan. The company calculated the total market value of those holdings as more than 8 trillion yen.
