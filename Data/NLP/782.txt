Microsoft s mobile problem may not be a problem at all: When Microsoft announced its Windows 10 strategy last year, the thinking was that the unified platform would drive Windows Mobile and finally bring the Windows phone out of the doldrums where it s been virtually forever. The idea was you could develop once for Windows 10 desktop and easily share that code on any device, making it impossibly attractive for developers, which would finally drive Windows Mobile popularity in a beautiful virtuous development cycle. Unfortunately, it hasn t worked out that way, and Microsoft finds itself in an unusual position, developing software for iOS and Android because it simply doesn t have a viable Windows mobile ecosystem. The question remains; can Microsoft succeed without a strong Windows mobile position  From the looks of things, they don t seem to have much choice. Nadella appears to be staking his position in the cloud, which is a perfectly reasonable way to play it, while opening up his company s tools to iOS and Android in the absence of any meaningful Windows phone adoption. When you look at the beauty of the mobile-cloud connection, it s understandable Microsoft would want to be there with Windows, but perhaps Nadella is beginning to understand that Windows is not necessarily the future of the company   Azure and Office 365 are   and that could explain why the company stayed firmly focused on these two areas at Build. When you combine that with the idea of bots created by Microsoft, including Cortana (Microsoft s talking virtual assistant), that can run in Microsoft s tools or external platforms like Slack and LINE, you start to see a vision where Microsoft thrives even without an in-house mobile platform. As the world moves swiftly to that mobile-cloud intersection, perhaps the underlying OS becomes less important. If that s the case   if Microsoft can have a piece of the underlying cloud-mobile plumbing and have apps and bots created in its ecosystem, run anywhere on any device   it renders the Windows phone gap irrelevant.
