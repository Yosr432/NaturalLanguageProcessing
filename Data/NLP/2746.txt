Amazon launches global shipping into China (from Amazon global stores) starting Singles Day: Amazon is planning an interesting move in China that could shift the balance somewhat starting with its Singles Day sale this year: global shipping. To be clear, this doesn t mean you can buy goods off of Amazon China from anywhere in the world. Rather, it means that Chinese consumers will be able to shop on Amazon s US, German, Spanish, French, and Italian stores and have whatever they order shipped directly to China. Amazon China is also launching an  international shopping  feature that should make it more convenient for Chinese customers to shop for goods they want from foreign Amazon shops. Moreover, the shipping may not take as long as you d expect; Amazon China has arranged partnerships with EMS, UPS, and other global shipping companies that should bring international orders to Chinese doorsteps faster than ever. The new partnerships promise to help customers get their orders through customs quickly, and some items may arrive within three days of being ordered. Sure, that s nothing compared to the speed of shipping within China, but for an international order, three days is very fast.
