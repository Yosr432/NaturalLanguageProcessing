Inmarsat switches to Arianespace for satellite launch after SpaceX delays: British satellite company Inmarsat will switch to using Arianespace from rival SpaceX to launch a new satellite to provide broadband connectivity to air passengers, it said on Thursday. The S-band satellite had been scheduled to launch with technology billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX but Inmarsat said setbacks to SpaceX's launch schedule prompted it to turn to Arianespace instead. Inmarsat said on Thursday that European-owned Arianespace will launch the S-band satellite in mid-2017. SpaceX has been forced to delay December rocket launches until January as an investigation continues into why one rocket burst into flames on September 1. SpaceX has a backlog of more than 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion.
