Amazon Is Launching a Live QVC-Type Show as Part of Push Into Fashion: By some estimates, Amazon could be the No. 1 apparel seller in the U.S. by next year. Now, it s unveiling a live daily show on Amazon.com to help push that initiative. Called  Style Code Live,  the free 30-minute video show will stream live on Amazon.com each weekday at 9 pm ET. The show will feature fashion and beauty tips and a live chat that the company says will allow viewers to communicate with the hosts. The most Amazon-y piece of the experience, though, will be a product carousel showing viewers the stuff related to the show that they can purchase on Amazon.com. And you have to believe this feature is as much about awareness for Amazon s clothing-selling business as it is about making direct sales of stuff from the show. It follows last week s Amazon announcement that it would begin airing a free reality show called  The Fashion Fund,  which documents a competition among up-and-coming fashion designers.
