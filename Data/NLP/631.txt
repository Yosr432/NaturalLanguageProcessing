Google's launch of a carpooling service Monday marks the beginning of its seemingly inevitable entry into the ridesharing wars. The pilot program, which is being offered via Google's Waze navigation app, aims to connect commuters who need a ride with drivers who can supply one. In exchange, riders will help cover the drivers' fuel costs. Consolidating rides means fewer cars on the road   which is better for traffic congestion and the environment, according to Waze.
