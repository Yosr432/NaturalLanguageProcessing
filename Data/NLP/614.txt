Snapchat is raising more money around $20 billion valuation: Snapchat may have first made its name in the crowded world of mobile apps with an ephemeral messaging service, but the startup and its wildly popular app are not disappearing anywhere soon. TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources that Snapchat is raising yet more financing at around a $20 billion valuation. Sources with knowledge of the deal say the social media giant is in the process of a round of about $200 million. This new financing, we understand, is a follow-on to the $175 million Series F round led by Fidelity. Snapchat was said to be valued at $16 billion in that round, flat on the year before. However, filings from earlier this month and embedded below, uncovered for us by market analysts VC Experts, show that the Series F was expanded.Expanding the Series F with a Series FP, as it s described in the document below, would also fit in with a description we ve heard more than once about Snapchat s fundraising: The startup is  always raising  on a  rolling  basis, partly because investors are so interested.  They get offers all the time,  one investor close to the company said.  And once you start to grow on this path, many people come to give you money. You don t know how to value the company, so the best way to do that is to do some kind of rolling funding. When you have a hot company and many people are approaching you, you do a market of discovery.  That may be different from other startups, but in a way it reflects Snapchat s own fast growth and its taste for trying out new things like QR codes to connect to accounts and content, their crazy face-changing filters and more.
