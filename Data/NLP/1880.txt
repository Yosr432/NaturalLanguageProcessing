HTC Drops to Decade Low After Cutting Quarterly Sales Forecast. HTC Corporation fell to the lowest in a decade in Taipei after the smartphone maker cut its sales forecast as much as 35 percent and announced plans to write off $94 million of impaired assets. Shares fell by 9.9 percent, the daily limit, to the lowest since May 2005. Slower demand for high-end smartphones and weaker sales in China prompted the Taiwanese company to forecast second-quarter revenue of as low as NT$ 33 billion, compared with an April 28 forecast for NT$46 billion to NT$51 billion. The lower sales and writedown mean HTC will post a loss for the current quarter, it said.
