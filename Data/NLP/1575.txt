Alibaba Is Planning Its Comeback From the World s Biggest Wipeout of Market Value: It took less than a year for Alibaba to turn from a stock-market darling into the biggest source of shareholder losses worldwide. Alibaba s fiscal first-quarter sales are projected to climb 33 percent, the weakest pace in at least three years, to 21 billion yuan ($3.3 billion), according to the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a mean growth rate of 56 percent for the previous 12 quarters. Alibaba shares closed Tuesday at $77.34, down 35 percent from their Nov. 10 high. While the stock is still trading above its initial public offering price in September, the company has lost the equivalent of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. s entire market capitalization since its peak -- the world s biggest destruction of market value. The Hangzhou-based company is now ranked 24th worldwide with a value of $194 billion. After its record $25 billion IPO and 75 percent surge in the first two months of trading, Alibaba has been hit by a succession of bad news. Now, China s biggest e-commerce operator is plotting its comeback. This week s purchase of a stake in Suning -- Chairman Jack Ma s largest deal ever -- is part of the company s push to reach millions of new customers in rural China and abroad through a bigger logistics network. Ma is counting on expansion outside China s largest cities to offset a slowdown in sales growth that helped erase more than $90 billion of market value since Alibaba shares peaked in November. While the strategy may take time to bear fruit, Wall Street is keeping its faith before the release of Alibaba s quarterly results on Wednesday. Share-price forecasts tracked by Bloomberg imply a 35 percent rally over the next year, the second-biggest projected return among the world s 25 largest companies.
