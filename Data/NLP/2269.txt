Facebook's Instagram rolls out new 'carousel' ads: Instagram will let brand marketers showcase more images on its photo-sharing smartphone app, the Facebook-owned service s latest move to expand its money-making advertising features. The new  carousel ads  feature will let brands post multiple images, which users can scroll through by swiping their finger across the phone s screen. The idea, according to a post on Instagram s official blog on Wednesday, is to match the multi-page ad campaigns found in print magazines. An automobile company, for example, could highlight different features of a new car and include a link to a website with more product information. The carousel ads feature will initially be available in the United States to a limited set of advertising partners, Instagram said. Instagram, which Facebook Inc acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has 300 million monthly users. The new ad service marks the latest step in Instagram s effort to position its mobile service as an online marketing channel. Instagram introduced photo ads in late 2013 and rolled out video ads last year.
