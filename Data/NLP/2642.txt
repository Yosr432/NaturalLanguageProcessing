Creative agencies maybe feeling the squeeze as brands opt for web video shops to "just get stuff done": Increasingly, marketers are going directly to online production houses to produce Web video content. "The Internet has changed everything in terms of how consumers find, curate and watch branded content, and this is putting tremendous pressure on traditional ad agencies," noted ShareAbility CEO Tim Staples. "Succeeding at YouTube requires an expertise that most general ad agencies don t have, and the smart ones are not willing to risk a $50 million account for a $500,000 piece of content." Typically, these simple concept ideas are not related to a broader campaign, meaning they don t need the full strategy and cost of hiring a traditional agency, explained Altimeter analyst Rebecca Lieb. As an added bonus, digital studios are adept in turning things around quickly and know what s viral. "It's about hiring execution," she said. "Agencies do a lot of strategy and ideation, which is sometimes not what you need. Sometimes, you just need to get stuff done."
