Facebook Redefines 'Clicks' In Significant Changes to Pricing Model on Online Ads: Facebook is redefining the term  click  to appease its many advertisers. The social network will no longer charge marketers for what are known as engagement clicks   things such as  Likes,  comments or shares of an ad. Instead, Facebook will only count a click that generates a desired result for a marketer, like a website visit or an app install. The change comes just a few weeks after Facebook also changed up its definition for video  views.  Essentially, it s responding to advertisers that aren t interested in paying for someone to  Like  their advertisement when they would rather have an app install instead. These clicks are typically more expensive, but Facebook argues that they are also more valuable. It s a new approach for Facebook but not a new approach for the industry. Twitter started testing this kind of ad   called direct response ads   almost a year ago and rolled them out to all advertisers at the end of May. It s clear that advertisers want this model; Facebook and Twitter wouldn t change things up unless advertisers were clamoring for it.
