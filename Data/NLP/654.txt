What Do Consumers Want  Look at Their Selfies: Allison Shragal, 28, of Chicago, isn t a model, or Internet famous   she s an administrative assistant for a general contracting company. But almost every day companies pay her to snap photos of herself engaging in routine activities   brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, cleaning the bathroom. Her seemingly mundane images, when combined with thousands of others, contain insights that companies like Crest are eager to mine. They are using a Chicago-based company called Pay Your Selfie to gather those insights and present them in reports on consumer behavior that are meant to go where focus groups and surveys cannot. Among the tidbits that Crest, owned by Procter & Gamble, learned from its recent monthlong quest for selfies: There s a huge spike in brushing from 4 to 6 p.m., probably tied to a desire for happy-hour fresh breath. That knowledge could be useful when Crest decides which times of the day to start future social media campaigns. Users of the app receive anywhere from 20 cents to $1 for each  task  completed   in Crest s case, a snapshot taken  while brushing your teeth with your favorite Crest product.  Users can t double-dip; the app allows only one selfie per task. The selfies are a good way for companies to obtain information that people can t or don t articulate in focus groups or other traditional research methods, said Ravi Dhar, director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management. For example, they could lead to an understanding of which rituals go along with certain types of consumption, he said. Pay Your Selfie, which has been in business since last September, doesn t require participants to have followers on a site like Instagram. In fact, users don t have to share their images publicly at all (although they can). That makes it different from a company like Popular Pays, which offers Instagrammers the chance to post about brands like Nike in exchange for giveaways or cash.
