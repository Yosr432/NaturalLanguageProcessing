Seed funding is stagnant, but Series A and later rounds are still hot, analysis of VC funding data indicates: New data published today by Mattermark CEO and co-founder Danielle Morrill concerning the venture capital industry paints a relatively stiff picture: Seed rounds are taking it on the chin. More precisely, according to Mattermark, the number of seed rounds in 2014 fell compared to 2013, and the trend is accelerating. Bear in mind that the total dollar amount of money flowing into seed deals barely declined, so, of course, we are seeing the average seed deal increase. All this should square with your gut. It has felt for some time that the number of yahoos picking up a million dollars to build flipmeat for Yahoo has been declining. At the same time, the seed round your friend raised was almost a Series A. The data agrees. So has the seed bubble popped  I think it s fair to say that it has despite the only slight decline in the total dollar amount that is being invested at the level. That s due to the fact that we ve become too loose with what counts as a seed round. So if we used an older measuring stick, the downtick would be more accelerated.
