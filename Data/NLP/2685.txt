Facebook is giving select brands exclusive access to qualitative user insights based on information gleaned from its 1.3 billion users, letting high-rolling advertisers find out what consumers really think based on comments and other telling social activities, according to industry insiders familiar with the special program. The brands and their marketing teams get to dive deeper into Facebook and its unprecedented ability to gauge public sentiment thanks to the marketing program called Grapevine, according to sources. Which brands get invited to the program depends on their bankroll, one industry source said. "The advertisers spending in the millions on campaigns or a half-million dollars for one ad, that's who has access," this person said. Industry insiders said data analysis from Grapevine was "qualitative not just quantitative." For instance, a shampoo brand could get insights into what Facebook users are saying about frizzy hair and then tailor ads based on that sentiment.  The tool is similar to what Twitter does with its "firehose" of tweets, sifting through the torrent of information to track public sentiment. Twitter bought Gnip earlier this year to get a better handle on that data for marketers, and it licenses access to the full stream of information to a select few firms.
