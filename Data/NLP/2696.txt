A button for faster payment collection on e-commerce sites: PayUMoney (earlier PayUPaisa) has introduced a  Pay with PayUMoney  button to let online shoppers complete purchases with just a few clicks. The new feature will basically let e-tailers embed a button within their websites and blogs so that users can make payments without having to navigate away. According to the company, the button s look and design can be customised as per the website s design to collect details of customers. Its design also enables the same button to work for both web and mobile. PayU India further claims that over 2,188 merchants have already created the button for collecting payments. E-tailers who want to add the PayUMoney button on their sites / blogs can do so by logging in to PayUMoney and in the merchant dashboard going to PayUMoney tools. Post that, they can click on the PayUMoney button in order to create new button. The e-tailers can then specify the amount and customise the look and feel of the button. They can also add a custom field to collect more information about the customer. Once that is done, e-tailers can embed the button into their website and start collecting payments.
