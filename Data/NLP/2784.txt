Snapchat started monetizing! Gently though - only non-intrusive, non-targeted ads: The firm, valued at $10B, averages 100M users/month makes an app for sharing photographs that disappear in 1 to 10 seconds. Analysts opine that while Snapchat has a high engagement, particularly among millenials, its efforts to monetize will be hampered by its reputation as a sexting app, the short attention span of its users, and the absence of any audience targeting. (This attracted wide coverage - interesting links here,here and here). Snapchat's candid blog post, here, asserts that the move to display ads is simply because the firm 'need[s] to make money'. The first ad was for the horror film Ouija.
