Intel Said to End Talks to Buy Chip Designer Altera: Intel has ended discussions to buy Altera, a designer of specialized computer chips, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday, putting to rest what would have been the company s biggest-ever takeover. The collapse of the talks halts what would have been the latest in a series of mergers of chip makers and designers as companies turn to consolidation to gain negotiating leverage with customers. And yet investors still appear hopeful that Altera will ultimately be sold. Though shares of Altera initially fell after CNBC reported the end of negotiations, they closed up 3 percent on Thursday, at $43.33. Shares in Intel ended down slightly, at $31.24. Intel first made a takeover offer several weeks ago of more than $50 a share, a premium of more than 40 percent to Altera s stock price at the time, one of the people said. Ultimately, however, Altera rejected the approach, and talks between the two companies had gone quiet in recent days. It was unclear whether the talks would be revived. A takeover would have been, by far, the biggest deal by Intel in its 46-year history. To date, its largest takeover was the $7.5 billion acquisition of McAfee, a security software maker. Just six of the company s deals have been worth more than $1 billion. Several analysts have said that they still think Intel will be on the hunt for acquisitions.
