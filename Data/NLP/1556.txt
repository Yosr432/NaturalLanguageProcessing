Uber s Popularity in India Has Led to a Mini Vehicle Boom: Uber has posed a threat to auto sales by enticing car owners to ditch their keys. In India, its popularity has sparked a vehicle boom instead. Maruti Suzuki has seen a surge in demand for its DZire Tour sedan because of the rising popularity of car-booking apps, said R.S. Kalsi, executive director at India s largest carmaker. Toyota Motor is offering special deals to woo drivers and fleet operators that are boosting orders for its Etios sedan, which starts at 611,000 rupees ($9,400). Uber and other booking apps have announced plans to expand to smaller cities in India, where public transportation is often inadequate. The services have created a boom in demand from for-hire car companies expanding their fleets and from individual operators buying new cars to drive for the apps.  The plans of all these companies are big,  said N. Raja, director and senior vice president for sales and marketing at Toyota s India unit.  We re happy to see them talking about expanding the number of cars in the next 12 months.  In the four months through July, Maruti Suzuki s DZire Tour, sold only as a taxi, surged 152 percent while Toyota s Etios compact sedan gained 28 percent. Industrywide passenger-vehicle sales expanded 7.5 percent in the same period. The surge in demand for these cheaper models is helping to drive a recovery in vehicle sales in India. Automakers like Maruti Suzuki get about a third of their sales volume from rural areas, where incomes are correlated to rainfall during the monsoon season and a good harvest.
