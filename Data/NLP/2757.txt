Meanwhile Renren (in 2011 touted as the Facebook of China) serves as a cautionary reminder that valuations can be fleeting:  Renren Inc. (RENN) was touted the Facebook Inc. of China when it debuted in New York in 2011. Today it s looking more like online flameout Myspace. The stock has lost more than three quarters of its value since 2011.  When Renren appeared, students like me added as many friends as possible, but you get tired scrolling through horoscopes and advertisements searching for original content, because WeChat looked like a more enticing platform for posting news and reading comments,  Hou said by phone on Oct. 21.  It was the same with Myspace: you log in, you scroll through your newsfeed -- to find out that all the interesting conversations are happening on Facebook.  Three years after the IPO, the networking website s valuation has fallen to less than eight times sales. The 24-year-old still checks her Renren account about three times a week, though for WeChat  it s every hour,  she said. Monthly unique users decreased to about 44 million as of June, Renren said in a statement in August. That compares with more than 438 million monthly active users for WeChat and 157 million users for Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service controlled by Sina Corp.
