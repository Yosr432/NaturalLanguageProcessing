Four years and $22 billion later, WhatsApp has decided ads aren t awful, after all: First rule about being bought by an advertising company: You re probably going to end up selling advertising.  WhatsApp to share user data with Facebook for ad targeting. Facebook-owned messaging giant WhatsApp has announced a big change to its privacy policy which, once a user accepts its new T&Cs, will see it start to share some user data with its parent company   including for ad-targeting purposes on the latter service.  [B]y coordinating more with Facebook, we ll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp,  WhatsApp writes in a blog on the change today.  Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them. For example, you might see an ad from a company you already work with, rather than one from someone you ve never heard of.  WhatsApp will also be sharing the data with the  Facebook family of companies    so presumably its user data could also be fed to VR firm Oculus Rift, another Fb acquisition, and photo-sharing network Instagram. WhatsApp data that will be shared under the new T&Cs includes the phone number a user used to verify their account, and the last time they used the service. Two pieces of data which   on a creepiness scale of  personal intel you d rather not hand over to a data-mining tech giant    are both right up there.
