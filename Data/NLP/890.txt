LinkedIn Is Now Allowing Marketers to Target Ads at Specific Companies: On Tuesday, the company announced that marketers running native ads through Sponsored Updates or Sponsored InMail campaigns can target user profiles based on a list of companies they want to target specific products or other sales to. The feature, which is appropriately named LinkedIn Account Targeting, allows marketers to provide a list of as many as 30,000 companies they want to target in a campaign. LinkedIn then checks to see which of those are among the 8 million companies on the platform before targeting those pages and profiles of people at those companies based on criteria such as job duties and seniority. According to Lindsey Edwards, senior product manager for LinkedIn Marketing Solutions, LinkedIn has traditionally focused on bringing profile data job titles, seniority level, skills and groups to advertisers and marketers for targeting purposes. But this is the first time LinkedIn is letting companies bring their own data to the platform. Previously, marketers could only target up to 100 companies, mostly only by manual selection. In some ways, LinkedIn is bucking the trend by opening its "walled garden" (a commonly used metaphor for how companies like Google and Facebook withhold data from marketers using their closed ad buying systems). Edwards said marketers can start "digging in" by bringing their own data.
