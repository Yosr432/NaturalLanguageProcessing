Modi Offers $1.5 Billion Fund, Tax Breaks for India Startups: India said it will set up a 100-billion-rupee ($1.5 billion) fund to encourage startup businesses and pledged to ease regulations for entrepreneurs, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi strives to create the jobs needed in a developing nation of 1.3 billion people. Startups will get tax breaks such as income-tax exemptions for the first three years, quicker patent applications, a credit guarantee program and easier routes to wind up if they fail, Modi said at a government conference for entrepreneurs in New Delhi. The fund will be established over four years. "The government should not interfere in startups," Modi said on Saturday to an audience that included billionaire Masayoshi Son, the founder of Japan s SoftBank Group Corp., and Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick. "India s youth should be a job creator, not a seeker."
