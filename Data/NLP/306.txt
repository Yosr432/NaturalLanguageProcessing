BMW uses remote locking to trap car thief suspect inside stolen vehicle: A suspect in a Seattle car theft had a rude awakening last week when the car he allegedly stole seemed to take on a life of its own. The man accused of stealing a BMW 550i on Nov. 30 found himself trapped inside the stolen car while surrounded by law enforcement officers in Seattle. The car's owner   a newlywed bride who had just tied the knot the day before   had lent her BMW to a friend, according to the Seattle Police Department's blotter. The friend parked the car at the owner's place that night, leaving the key fob inside the vehicle and forgetting to lock the doors. Police said a 38-year-old man  found the  car unlocked and hopped in, taking it for a joy ride before pulling over and falling asleep. The car's owner awoke to find her car missing and notified the police, who contacted BMW's roadside assistance program to help locate the vehicle, the police report said. The man was arrested and charged with auto theft and drug possession due to the small amount of methamphetamine discovered on him, police said. Several automakers   including BMW, Audi and Toyota   offer remote locking and tracking in their vehicles. It is frequently cited as a safety feature should a car be stolen.
