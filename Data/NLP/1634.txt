Twitter Shares Surge on Earnings Beat, then Slump on Slowing User Growth: After reporting quarterly sales that topped estimates, interim Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey and Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto struck a critical tone, saying user growth won t improve until the social-media company reaches a mass market -- something that will take a mixture of product improvements and marketing. The company s efforts so far have had minimal success, they said. Shares dropped 11 percent in extended trading, after climbing as much as 12 percent following the earnings release. n the second quarter, revenue rose 61 percent to $502.4 million, the social-media company said Tuesday in a statement. That exceeded analysts  average projection for $481.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twitter s net loss narrowed to $136.7 million, or 21 cents a share. Profit excluding certain items was 7 cents, compared with the 4 cents analysts estimated. On a conference call, executives quashed any initial optimism generated by the report by confronting Twitter s underlying problem: It s much smaller than the competition. The company today reported 316 million monthly users, while Facebook has 1.4 billion. Twitter recently started counting feature-phone users in emerging markets as part of its tally. Without that extra boost, Twitter s user count was 304 million. Noto said Twitter changed its tone on the call because growth slowed so meaningfully, the company wanted to explain how it s working to address the deceleration.  In the past we may not have had the growth that investors wanted us to have, but it was still quite strong. And this quarter we barely had any growth.
