Add a Fund to Amazon Cart  You Have Indian Regulator's Support: Indians are estimated to spend about $9 billion this year shopping online for everything from smartphones to cupcakes. The nation s stock market regulator wants them to add another product to their shopping cart: mutual funds. The Securities & Exchange Board of India plans to change its regulations to allow online marketplaces such as Flipkart Online Services Pvt. and Amazon.com Inc. to offer funds alongside other products, Chairman U.K. Sinha said in an interview at his office in Mumbai. Mutual funds have gained popularity among Indian savers, receiving more money in the past 17 months than they did in the preceding 12 years. Yet just 3 percent of the nation s 1.2 billion people invest in them, with majority preferring bank deposits or gold, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Allowing e-commerce sites to sell funds will help money managers reach out to young investors accustomed to shopping online, providing the industry with a new distribution channel, Sinha said.
