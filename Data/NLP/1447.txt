Ubers Are About To Start Carrying Their Own In-Car Magazine: Starting this week in NYC, you can grab a copy of Uber s new in-car magazine, called  Arriving Now,  from the seat-back pockets. A new print publication isn t exactly a revolutionary move (airlines have been rocking inflight magazines for a while), but Uber has an interesting opportunity here to test the content waters. At face value, it seems like kind of a funny move for them to get into the truly burgeoning print journalism market, but there are a ton of different directions that this could be taken. Uber is probably more interested here in testing out a content arm where they can push out cool stories that gives people a better  brand experience  with the company. Though most people probably spend their time on a phone in the back of an Uber regardless, seat-back, always-on touch screens could probably be coming soon enough to a car near you, allowing users more ways to interact with Uber s continually growing on-demand services that don t necessarily involve getting people from place-to-place.
