What's the deal  Softbank (and Alibaba) are heavily investing taxi apps that rival Uber the world over: SoftBank had no business in taxi-hailing apps until October 2014 when it led a $210 million investment in India s Ola. That deal was announced as the first investment in SoftBank s program to put $10 billion into startups in India. At the time, Ola appeared to be just one of a number of deals in India   while that is true, it also turned out to be the first of an expensive set of investments in companies rivals that rival Uber. SoftBank went on to invest $250 million in GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia, and last week it closed a third deal, leading a $600 million financing round for China s Kuadi Dache. The operator, it seems is going all out for taxi apps but it may not stop in Asia. Alibaba led Lyft s $250 million funding round in April 2014, which the U.S. company had earmarked for  international expansion . At the time, the investment was a curious deal for Alibaba but, with the e-commerce giant backing range of other U.S. startups   including chat app Tango   it looked like an exploratory move to get some skin in promising companies in North America. However, SoftBank and Alibaba have a long history of collaboration   SoftBank is famously an early investor in Alibaba, and both companies put money into Kuadi Dache   and it could just be that Lyft forms a part of SoftBank s taxi app focus. Perhaps the Japanese firm will put its own money in at a later date, or it will use its relationship with Alibaba to form a loose alliance to share information and tactics.
