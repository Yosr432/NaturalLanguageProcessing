Alibaba Expands in Southeast Asia With $1 Billion Lazada Deal: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is making its largest overseas investment with a $1 billion deal for control of Lazada Group SA, taking the Chinese e-commerce giant to Southeast Asia and closer to a goal of shedding its home-market reliance. China s largest online emporium will pay $500 million for new shares in the closely held company and purchase an equal amount from existing investors, Alibaba said in a statement. Investors selling include Germany s Rocket Internet SE, British supermarket chain Tesco Plc and Investment AB Kinnevik. The Chinese company is buying its way into a region on the cusp of an online shopping boom, as fast-growing mobile and Internet usage propels consumer spending. Billionaire Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma has set a goal of getting at least half the company s revenue from overseas, with the Lazada deal adding sales of clothing and electronics in six Southeast Asian markets. While the deal is Alibaba s biggest deal abroad to date, the e-commerce giant is no stranger to mega-acquisitions. It agreed to pay about $5 billion to take full control of Chinese video service Youku Tudou Inc. in 2015. Alibaba shares were little changed in U.S. trading at $77.86 and have dropped 4.2 percent this year. The agreement values Lazada at $1.5 billion, Rocket said in a separate statement. It s selling a 9.1 percent stake in Lazada and keeping an 8.8 percent slice. Alibaba s deal values its entire stake in the company at about 15 times its total invested capital of 18 million euros ($21 million), the German technology company incubator said.
