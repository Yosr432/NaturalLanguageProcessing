Alphabet s Earnings Miss Forecasts: European regulators brought the hammer down on Google this week, and investors barely blinked. But when the company s first-quarter numbers came in a little light on Thursday afternoon, its stock immediately plummeted. Both revenue and profit rose sharply from 2015 but missed analysts  forecasts. Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96. The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading. Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.Revenue from what the company calls  Other Bets    including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat   was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015. Losses for Other Bets rose to $802 million from $633 million. The number of employees jumped to 64,000 from 55,000 last year.  The vast majority  of them, the company stressed, were engineers and product managers. A question hanging over Google is its ventures in cloud computing. This is the growth market where Amazon is far ahead of everyone. Amazon Web Services is more exciting to investors than the retailer s core business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is mounting an aggressive challenge. Google is far behind at No. 3, or perhaps even No. 4 after IBM, said John R. Rymer, an analyst at Forrester Research. Last fall, Google hired Diane Greene, an industry veteran, to run all of its cloud businesses.
