Facebook Launches Dedicated Web Interface For Messenger: Ever try to read a Facebook message on the web and get distracted by your News Feed and notifications  Well now Facebook has a way to let you use Messenger in peace from your web browser. Today it launched Messenger.com as a dedicated chat interface. It s rolling out worldwide for English users, with support for more languages to come. You can still send messages from Facebook.com as always, but Messenger.com could become a favorite of busy users concerned with productivity, or those that use Facebook to chat with friends but don t like the social content chaos of its main site. The company tells me the  dedicated desktop messaging experience  is  meant to be complimentary to the Messenger mobile app . The move follows the launch of Facebook acquisition WhatsApp s web interface in January. One big question is whether Facebook will release a desktop client for Messenger. That could rescue chat from the crowded web browser and make it instantly accessible with a single click from people s desktops.
