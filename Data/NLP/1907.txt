Snapchat Said to Be Valued at $16 Billion in New Fundraising: Snapchat raised $537.6 million in a sale of common stock, with the funding round valuing the messaging startup at about $16 billion. The company may raise as much as $650 million in the round, according to a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would bring Snapchat s total financing to more than $1.2 billion, according to Crunchbase, as the company builds its business in pursuit of an eventual initial public offering. By raising the latest funding in common stock, Snapchat is bucking convention for later-stage venture deals, which tend to include preferred-stock provisions that allow investors to decrease their risk.  Investing in common stock, especially at a $16 billion valuation, is not normal,  said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of venture-capital data firm CB Insights.  It highlights the leverage that Snapchat had in these negotiations because the investors aren t getting the protections they normally ask for.
