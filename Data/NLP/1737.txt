Euro markets set for major jolt after Greek 'No', look to ECB for calm: European stock and bond markets are set to take a sharp hit on Monday after Greece voted 'No' to harsh bailout conditions, and bankers said the European Central Bank's response was now key to the extent of contagion. "The ECB has the capacity to limit the spread of contagion. But we might still see a fall of 3 percent on European markets on Monday," said Antonin Jullier, head of equity trading strategy at Citi. With no immediate prospect of a bailout for the Greek government, its banks need further help to avoid collapsing. Oil prices tumbled as the US dollar strengthened. European officials are putting the onus on the Greek government to make the next move as Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Paris on Monday for talks with President Francois Hollande to map out a way forward for Greece.
