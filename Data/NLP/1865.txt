IBM plans Data Analytics push - bets on Spark, open-source software project that aims to be Hadoop successor.IBM has created a Technology Center in San Francisco to focus on a free open-source software project called Spark, according to IBM executive Rob Thomas. IBM hired 20 people within the last month, Thomas said in a video posted online June 3.  We re going to be scaling this up to hundreds of people that are just focused on Spark open source and how we evolve that for the enterprise,  Thomas said. Spark is a framework developed originally at the University of California at Berkeley that helps companies process large amounts of data rapidly, by storing information within the fast memory of computers. It is seen by many in Silicon Valley as a potential successor to Hadoop, which has spawned a variety of companies including Cloudera, MapR Technologies and Hortonworks.  This is a much more significant bet than even what we have done on Hadoop to be frank,  Thomas said.  We think Spark is going to be enormous and change the face of enterprise IT.
