Twitter slipping: behind Instagram in users, behind Yahoo in 2015 mobile revenues, out of Glassdoor's top 50 best employers list:  Instagram is adding an average of 360k new active users per day; For comparison Twitter is adding 160k new users per day,  Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co., said today in a tweet. Twitter declined to comment on Instagram s announcement. San Francisco-based Twitter has recently been on a campaign to promote its prospects after several quarters of slowing user growth and questions about whether it can ever reach the scale of Facebook, which has about 1.3 billion members. Monthly active user count at Twitter rose 23 percent in the third quarter, down from 24 percent growth the prior quarter.
