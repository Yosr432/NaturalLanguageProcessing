Chinese agency softens criticism of Alibaba on sales of fake goods: It was only two days ago that a Chinese government regulator chastised the Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant, for failing to curb the sale of fake goods on its sites. Now the two appear to have made up in a hurry. The regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Friday that its leader, Zhang Mao, had met with Alibaba s executive chairman, Jack Ma, to discuss cooperating to fight counterfeiting and protect consumers. The agency made its criticism of Alibaba in a report released on Wednesday. But it is now backing away from the findings of that report, calling it a recounting of a July meeting between the two sides and not an official document with legal weight. It is a surprisingly quick turn of events for both Alibaba and the Chinese agency, given the public criticism that the S.A.I.C. delivered to one of its country s most important Internet players. The S.A.I.C. s blunt tone disappeared in the Friday statement. The agency described Alibaba as  steadfast and resolute  in fighting the sale of counterfeit goods, though it maintained that e-commerce platforms in China still needed to improve their self-policing. Both sides pledged to work more closely on matters like creating new regulatory mechanisms.  Both sides believe that the regulators and online platforms share the common interest to promote the healthy development of the online commerce industry and creating an online shopping environment where consumers feel safe and satisfied,  the regulator said, according to an English-language translation of its statement. In a post on its corporate blog, Alibaba said it planned to hire 300 people to form an anticounterfeiting task force to bolster its policing staff. A representative for Alibaba said in a statement:  The most recent S.A.I.C. posting speaks for itself. We feel vindicated.
