Verizon set to make Yahoo's bidder short list, as Yahoo reports tepid earnings: Verizon Communications Inc was set on Tuesday to advance to the second stage of bidding for Yahoo Inc's core assets, as the U.S. internet company went through offers to put together a short list, people familiar with the matter said. The field had whittled down ahead of Monday's first-round bid deadline as several companies that were mulling an offer, including Comcast Corp and Time Inc, decided to opt out, the people said. Meanhile, Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, said revenue fell 11 percent to $1.09 billion, and its net loss was $99 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to revenue of $1.23 billion and net income of $21 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
