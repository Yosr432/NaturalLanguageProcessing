Brands Hope You Like Them Enough to Pin Them at the Top of Your Facebook News Feed: An update to Facebook's news feed allows users to select a group of preferred friends, whose posts will always appear at the top of the home page. Facebook is billing the feature as an extra layer of personalization on top of what the news feed algorithm selects for users automatically, based on their behavior. In addition to selecting best friends, Facebook also gives users the ability to choose from the list of pages they've  Liked  for retail and consumer brands, news organizations, or interest groups. The ones that make the cut will also appear at the top of a user's news feed, along with family and best buds. The feature gives hope to marketing executives who felt burned by an overcrowded news feed that meant even fans rarely saw their updates. Some companies had been paying Facebook to advertise their pages and increase  Likes,  an expense that made less sense if people weren't seeing the posts. Now a user who designates pages as important will  see any new stories they ve shared since your last visit to Facebook at the top of News Feed, with a star in the top right of their post so you know why they re at the top,  according to Facebook.  You can scroll down to see the rest of your News Feed normally.
