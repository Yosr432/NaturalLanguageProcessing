Shopify Doubles Down on  Buy  Buttons Despite Sluggish Start: Last year certainly wasn t the year of the  Buy  button that some envisioned, but Shopify is betting that 2016 could be. The e-commerce company, which makes software that small businesses use to sell products online, is expanding the number of online sales channels its customers can sell through as shopping on mobile devices booms. The new channels include product discovery app Wanelo, home design site Houzz and coupon app Ebates; Shopify said that more are on the way.  This is a continued bet on distributed commerce,  said Satish Kanwar, Shopify s director of product. The expansion follows Shopify s previous work to let its merchants start selling directly on Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest, in addition to their own sites. But shopping on Pinterest got off to a slow start last year, and e-commerce efforts on Twitter and Facebook are still in early stages.
