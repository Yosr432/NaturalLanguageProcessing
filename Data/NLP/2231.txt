Lyft plans to be profitable by 2016, targests $2.7 B topline and reduced driver acquisition spends : Last week on-demand transportation service Lyft announced that it had raised $530 million in new funding as it seeks to steal market share away from arch-rival Uber and launch services in new markets in the U.S. and internationally. While it is clearly second to Uber in both markets it serves and financing it s raised, Lyft s financial projections at least show a path to profitability in the next 24 months. This year Lyft is targeting nearly $1.2 billion in gross revenues, of which its take will be around $300 million net. That assumes between 20 and 25 percent commission for the rides it books. In 2016, Lyft expects its revenues to more than double(targeting $2.7 billion). That revenue growth is driven by an increase in the number of rides and passengers that Lyft serves. The company is targeting nearly 90 million rides in total for 2015, which it expects to more than double to 205 million in the year following. While Lyft is generating a lot of cash, it also has a number of costs associated with running the business, including credit card processing fees, insurance, and taxes. After those costs, Lyft forecasts a $170 million gross profit in 2015, which it expects to grow to about $400 million in 2016. That said, its gross profit number doesn t take into account Lyft s customer and driver acquisition costs, which the company is using to prime the pump and grow both supply and demand. In 2015, Lyft expects to spend $150 million to acquire new users, while spending an additional $50 million on getting drivers on board to shuttle them around. Taking those numbers into account, there s a delta of around $30 million between its gross profit and acquisition costs this year. In 2016, the financial picture gets a little better: While gross profit is expected to grow to around $400 million, its spend on driver and passenger acquisition is forecast to increase only slightly, to around $250 million.
