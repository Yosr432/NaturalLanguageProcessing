Tech patents are increasingly in the news: Story #1: Priceline.com's founder attempts a marketplace for tech patents, and China announces plans to triple the number of patents filed by 2020: In 1997, Jay Walker founded Priceline.com   the Web site many people use to get cheaper airfare by "naming your own price." Patenting the solution, and allowing others to use the patents for a fee, helped drive Walker's success. But, Walker argues in an interview, many patents remain underused. Now, the man who smoothed transactions for buyers and sellers of airplane tickets wants to do something similar for a key part of the nation's information economy. Walker is developing something called the United States Patent Utility.  "We're going to form a utility, which works as a neutral party for both inventors of technology and users of technology. So you would be listing your patents as available for use. Then the next thing we're going to do is, we're going to say to people who are small to medium sized companies, get on the phone with us and talk to us for about 10 or 15, 20 minutes and tell us about your products and services. Send us PDFs of your sales manuals, your technical literature we can ingest, and we'll build a model of the technologies and products you use. If you're a shoe manufacturer, we can take all your specifications, all your sales materials, and we can read it all into the system. And then what we do is use a set of Big Data algorithms to take your specifications of all your products and services and run it up against the entire U.S. database of patents, which is about 2-plus million active patents. We run it against all the inactive patents, all the expired patents. Think of it as a natural-language kind of way. You don't need to be a programmer any more for it to run up against the entire database.
