Amazon is expanding its on-demand home services business -- "Amazon Home Services" -- to 15 new cities: Amazon announced Wednesday that it's expanding its on-demand home services business -- transparently named "Amazon Home Services" -- to 15 new cities. The program was already operating in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles, offering users an easy way to book plumbers, electricians, cleaners and other people who can handle the things you may need around the house. The company announced that it is also expanding the service to let people request help with custom jobs, rather than just the pre-packaged services previously offered. The competition in the on-demand space for home tasks is heating up. Companies such as TaskRabbit jumped in early to the "gig" economy -- in fact, it integrates with Home Services -- and now a host other of cleaning, laundry and other service companies such as Handy, Thumbtack and others have found success providing on-demand workers to take care of your home needs. Amazon says its Home Services "pros," as the service calls them, are vetted and required to keep all appropriate licenses to continue working with the service. Some use Amazon to expand their own businesses. Google is also thought to be jumping into the space. The company recently hired the technical team from Homejoy, a home-cleaning startup that shut down in part because it faced a lawsuit for classifying its workers as contractors rather than employees, Recode reported. The report suggested that Google may try and bake some sort of services link into its search results -- a sort of instant referral from the search page.
