Amazon Can Now Ship Packages From China to the U.S. by Sea - Enters the Ocean Freight Business: Amazon's China subsidiary has registered in the U.S. to operate as an ocean freight forwarder, an entity that organizes the shipment of goods from a supplier or factory in one region   say, China   to a company or customer somewhere far away, like the U.S. The registration was unearthed by Flexport, a San Francisco-based logistics startup that published a blog post on the news today.  Amazon China now has the appropriate paperwork to provide ocean freight services for other companies,  the blog post read.  This is Amazon s first step toward entering the $350 billion ocean freight market.  The move comes as Amazon continues to make inroads in controlling more of what happens after a customer clicks  Buy  to ultimately cut down on shipping costs and improve speed and reliability of deliveries. In the blog post, Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen suggests that Amazon s competitive advantage over old-school freight forwarders will be the automation of some steps of the shipment process through software, thus cutting labor costs along the way.
