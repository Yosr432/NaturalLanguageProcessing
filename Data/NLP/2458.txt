Uber closes $1.6 Billion in convertible debt that incentivize Uber to IPO in less than 4 years; also in talks to raise $600M in Series E; valuation at $41.2B: Uber, the popular ride-hailing start-up, has closed $1.6 billion in financing from clients of Goldman Sachs s private wealth arm, the investment bank confirmed on Wednesday. The new round of financing comes just months after the company raised $1.2 billion from big institutions. Including that investment, the company is valued at some $41.2 billion, one of the richest-ever valuations for a private start-up. Moreover, Uber may still raise an additional $600 million in stock from hedge funds and strategic overseas investors, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing. The funding adds to Uber s already overflowing war chest; to date, the company has raised upward of $4 billion. With the new cash, Uber has more incentive to take on a new life as a publicly traded company. The securities sold to Goldman s clients   in what was one of the biggest-ever sales of convertible debt   can be converted into shares in the start-up once it begins trading on a stock exchange, at a discount of 20 percent to 30 percent of the price set in an initial public offering, people briefed on the matter have said. Should the company not stage an I.P.O. within four years, however, the interest rate on those securities will rise.
