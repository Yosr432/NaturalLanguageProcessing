Computer Scientists Are Astir After Baidu Team Is Barred From A.I. Competition: A group of researchers at the Chinese web services company Baidu have been barred from participating in an international competition for artificial intelligence technology after organizers discovered that the Baidu scientists broke the contest s rules. The competition, which is known as the  Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge,  is organized annually by computer scientists at Stanford University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan. It requires that computer systems created by the teams classify the objects in a set of digital images into 1,000 different categories. The rules of the contest permit each team to run test versions of their programs twice weekly ahead of a final submission as they train their programs to  learn  what they are seeing. However, on Tuesday, the contest organizers posted a public statement noting that between November and May 30, different accounts had been used by the Baidu team to submit more than 200 times to the contest server,  far exceeding the specified limit of two submissions per week.  This year, Baidu announced that it had built a custom supercomputer named Minwa with the intention of dedicating it to the image recognition contest. Baidu researchers subsequently made a series of announcements about the success of the computer, including one playing up a result more accurate than an earlier score by Google scientists. On May 4, Baidu posted an article on its technology blog headlined  Baidu Achieves Top Results on Image Recognition Challenge.  The article has since been removed.
