Facebook reports strong earnings: revenue up 42% Y/Y to $3.54B, ad sales up 46%; DAU of 936M up 17% Y/Y; stock down 4% on topline miss driven by FX: Sales rose 42 percent to $3.54 billion, when they could have risen 49 percent without the currency effects, Facebook said Wednesday in a statement. Advertising sales gained 46 percent to $3.32 billion from a year earlier, and would have increased 55 percent excluding currency fluctuations, Facebook said. Ad sales make up about 94 percent of the company s annual revenue. Facebook said its main application has 1.44 billion monthly active users, compared with 1.39 billion in the fourth quarter and analysts  estimates of 1.43 billion. About 73 percent of ad revenue came from mobile phones, an increase from about 59 percent a year earlier, the company reported. more people are visiting Facebook daily, with the company reporting daily active users of 936 million on average in March, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier. Facebook s sales failed to meet analysts  estimates for the first time since April 2012, and shares declined as much as 4.3 percent in extended trading after closing at $84.63. The stock has increased 8.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 2.4 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. Shift to Mobile Accelerates: Facebook is now so thoroughly a mobile service that its original website may soon become a footnote in the company s financial statements. The world s largest social network reported on Wednesday that almost three-quarters of its advertising revenue and most of its 1.44 billion users came from cellphones and other mobile devices in the first quarter of the year. And Facebook is beginning to make a similar transition from text to video, with its users already watching four billion videos a day, an average of four per person (although the view may be more like a glance, since Facebook considers three seconds long enough to count). Usage in Asia continues to grow: In Asia, the headline number is that Facebook has now grown to 471 million monthly active users (MAUs) in Q1 2015, up from 390 million MAUs the same period the year earlier. That s out of a global total of 1.44 billion MAUs in the newest figures.
