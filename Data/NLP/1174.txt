Thanksgiving Final Results   OmniChannel Strikes Back: This morning we are releasing the final results from Thanksgiving 2015. What stands out is the Omnichannel players with stores and online marketplaces (Best Buy, Sears, etc.) did extremely well.  This indicates that these  Brick and Clicks  retailers were really able to tie their store and online promotions together with great success. This data is date-shifted to compare Thanksgiving this year  (Nov 26) vs. last year (Nov 27).  In summary, Thanksgiving 2015 blew the doors off, coming in at 43.4% y/y growth compared to 20.1% last year   more than twice the rate of growth.  The trick is while we know that Thanksgiving 2015 was very strong, we don t know if this will continue through the entire Cyber Five and through all of Holiday 15, or if consumers are shopping much earlier than last year and will taper off as we get past Thanksgiving.  Omnichannel marketplaces led the pack with Google Shopping and Amazon also outperforming. From a device perspective, Smartphones were 58% of traffic compared to last year s Thanksgiving 35% and a new high water mark for this device type in our data.  From an order perspective, smartphone came in at 37% which was also more than double last year, although conversion rates continue to lag desktop and tablet considerably. Conclusion: consumers not only increased their Thanksgiving sales, but they utilized their smartphones heavily and favored omnichannel retailers.
