In a first, the FCC is fining a major cable company for getting hacked: In the first such case against a U.S. cable company, federal regulators are slapping Cox Communications with a $595,000 fine after Cox allowed hackers from Lizard Squad to penetrate its systems and steal private customer information. By posing as an IT administrator and tricking a couple of Cox employees into giving up their login credentials, a hacker known as "EvilJordie" broke into Cox's databases and gained access to customer names, addresses, password recovery information and even "partial" Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, according to the Federal Communications Commission. They also got hold of some customers' telephone records. As many as 61 current or former Cox customers were affected by the breach, which occurred between Aug. 7 and Aug. 14 of 2014. The hackers changed 28 of these customers' passwords, locking them out of their own accounts, and posted eight people's personal information on social media.
