Ten years after the iPhone, Apple is still looking for something to top it: As Apple celebrates 10 years since the introduction of the iPhone, investors and consumers alike are impatiently waiting for Apple s next big hit. But it turns out topping the iPhone is no easy task. After all, Apple has sold a billion of the suckers and, in the process, redefined mobile computing and became the world s most valuable company. The 2007 debut of the iPhone showed Apple at its best   entering a new category and completely changing the rules of the game. Apple did so with the iPod in 2001 and again a few years later with the iTunes Music Store. But, as revolutionary as those products were, Apple wasn t alone in seeing those opportunities   it just had a far better answer than anyone else. When the iPod debuted, there were other MP3 players on the market, even others with a hard drive   they were just big and clunky. Similarly, others tried to sell music before and after iTunes, but Apple s simplicity won the day. Even with the iPhone, plenty of people saw the collision of the phone, internet and iPod coming, but Apple was alone in its vision of how that combination should work. For its next act, though, it is highly likely the company will have to go further afield. Whether it s a car or something in digital health or augmented reality, it is clear that Apple will have to acquire at least as many outside skills as those it already has.
