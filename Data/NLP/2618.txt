Uber surge prices during Sydney standoff, then backs off, also UberPop banned in France. On Monday, as the police surrounded a cafe in Sydney, Australia, where an armed individual was holding hostages, Uber began raising rates. The move, which the company calls surge pricing, is governed by an algorithm and occurs whenever demand spikes for rides in an area. The idea is that higher rates give drivers incentive to fill the demand. With the authorities cordoning off part of the city s central business district, many who were stranded in the area were forced to pay roughly four times the normal rate, according to complaints on social media. In a relatively quick response, the company released a statement explaining what happened.  Surge pricing is algorithmic and responded automatically to the large increase in demand for Uber rides out of the C.B.D.,  it said, referring to the central business district.  As soon as we became aware of the situation, we capped it and made all rides free to people leaving Sydney s C.B.D. Uber is paying for these rides. If riders got charged surge pricing earlier, we will refund it.
