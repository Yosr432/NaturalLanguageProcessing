Lazada raises $250M Led By Temasek; valuation at $1.25B; H1 2014 GMV $91M (+202% Y/Y): The round is lead by Singapore s Temasek Holdings, which manages a $100-billion-plus portfolio and this year invested in another Amazon rival: Snapdeal in India. Lazada operates in six countries in Southeast Asia   Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam   largely in tandem with Zalora, another well-backed e-commerce service started by Rocket Internet. This new funding round takes Lazada to more than $700 million in money from investors. Its most recent round was also $250 million back in December 2013, which included an interesting strategic investment from UK retail giant Tesco. Together, Zalora and Lazada have probably raised around $1 billion in funding, although the value of some rounds were left undisclosed.  Raw figures about its business did reach the public domain this summer, however, as part of Rocket Internet s IPO in Germany. According to a filing reported by Tech In Asia, Lazada brought in $91.4 million in the first six months of 2014, generating 1.8 million orders from 1.4 million active users. Those modest returns perhaps explain why it has been placing more emphasis on its marketplace. Lazada says its marketplace now accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.
