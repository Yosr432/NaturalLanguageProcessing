Samsung Buys LoopPay, a Competitor to Apple s Mobile Wallet: Samsung, the South Korean technology giant, announced Wednesday it had acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments company, signaling its interest in controlling smartphone-based purchases. The move comes just months after the release of Apple Pay, Apple s mobile payments product, which allows consumers to buy things with little more than a wave of a smartphone. Though it has been available for only a handful of months, Apple Pay has gained significant traction with retailers and consumers. Whole Foods, the high-end grocery store, said it had processed thousands of Apple Pay transactions. Apple has also persuaded dozens of credit card issuers to sign up to support Apple Pay. LoopPay, however, believes its reach will extend far beyond that of Apple Pay. LoopPay s underlying technology relies on a magnetic transmission sent from a user s phone to a merchant s payment terminal, mimicking a credit card swipe. The technology, according to LoopPay, can be accepted in more than 90 percent of existing point-of-sale terminals. It is unclear if LoopPay will work on chip-and-pin terminals, which use a more secure form of credit card technology and are being widely phased in this year. Apple Pay relies on near-field communication technology, which Apple says is available at approximately 220,000 American locations. MST v NFC:  LoopPay uses magnetic secure transmission (MST) tech works with around 90 percent of existing payment terminals currently deployed in U.S. stores.  If you look at other competitor solutions in mobile payments [Apple Pay included], it s actually based on near-field technology, which has very limited coverage in the U.S. We see the MST technology that LoopPay owns has a lot of potential to really solve the end-user coverage issues with respect to point-of-sale terminals.  Samsung spotted the potential early: LoopPay launched a Kickstarter project in November of 2013, and was contacted by Samsung only  shortly thereafter,  according to Graylin.
