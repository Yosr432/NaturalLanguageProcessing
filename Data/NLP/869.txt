Subleases spike in number as SF startups downsize: In January, office rents in San Francisco eclipsed those of New York to become the most expensive in the country. Two months later, there are signs the San Francisco may not maintain its dubious position for long. The biggest indicator: There s suddenly 1.7 million square feet of sublease space available in San Francisco, up more than 50 percent from 1.1 million square feet in November, according to CBRE Group, a commercial real estate services and investment firm. That kind of jump in four months  time suggests ripple effects from a funding slowdown that stretch beyond a small but growing number of layoffs. If the trend isn t giving local landlords flashbacks of the late 1990s, it may soon. The Bay Area s real estate market enjoyed a historically active 2015, with San Francisco accounting for the world s highest rent growth at 14 percent, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. The last time San Francisco surpassed New York in price per square footage, says CBRE, was 2000, the same year the tech market famously peaked, then abruptly imploded.
