Google launched a cheap cloud storage service   promises data retrieval in 3 secs: Google is offering a new kind of data storage service called Nearline, for non-essential data. Like an AWS product called Glacier, this storage costs just a penny a month per gigabyte. Microsoft s cheapest listed online storage is about 2.4 cents a gigabyte. While Glacier storage has a retrieval time of several hours, though, Google said Nearline data will be available in about three seconds. The name is meant to evoke the idea of being nearly online at all times, It is also designed to move easily into other Google storage products, with sub-second data retrieval. That could make it a way to sell more expensive storage, as well as more analytics tools. Google s long game, in other words, is positioning itself as the cloud computing company for all kinds of data analysis, something that it at the heart of its search engine business.
