Facebook is testing a more conservative definition of video views, but is still far more aggressive than YouTube in charging advertisers: While Facebook charges advertisers for videos the second they appear in a news feed, views are defined differently since users can easily scroll past the ads. Facebook considers a view to last three seconds compared with YouTube's 30-second rule. This has resulted in marketers' clips uploaded to Facebook to amass a wealth of views compared with those published on YouTube in recent months. But those views don't necessarily mean people are watching ads. Now, advertisers can start paying for videos with a cost-per-view rate that kicks in after a user watches for 10 seconds, making the ad seemingly more valuable to advertisers who want to pay for qualified views. Until now, advertisers have paid for videos immediately after they show up in a news feed something akin to a cost-per-impression model. When Twitter launched autoplay video earlier this month, it tried to address concerns by promising brands 100 percent viewability: promising only to charge on video ads that have been seen 100 percent in full view of the user..
