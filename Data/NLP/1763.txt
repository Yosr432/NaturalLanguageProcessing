Google's Local Search, unlike Google's Organic Search, Favors Google+ Results, Yelp Claims: According to a highly critical new paper out from legal scholar Tim Wu, Harvard Business School professor Michael Luca and data scientists at Yelp, many of us are totally missing out on the information that s most relevant, and critical, to our lives. In a statement to The Washington Post, Yelp vice president of public policy Luther Lowe uses this example: If a parent searches  pediatrician NYC,  he or she will, in a prominent first-page listing, see the names of seven pediatricians who happen to have Google+ or Google+ Local pages.  The Google organic ranking algorithm does a great job at identifying helpful content on the Web,  Lowe said.  But it s sadly not being deployed in the most common user behavior on Google: local search.  According to Yelp, from one-third to one-half of all Google searches are local. They primarily involve something called the  Local OneBox    the special, extra-prominent list of seven links that Google displays at the top of local search results. Local OneBox takes up a big chunk of first-page real estate, frequently at the very top of the page, which means people are disproportionately more likely to click into it than they are into regular links. Local OneBox also pulls exclusively from Google s versions of specialized search sites, such as Google+ Local.
