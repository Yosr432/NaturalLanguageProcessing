Chinese click on far more mobile ads than Americans, rely far less on TV and watch a lot of videos while commuting: The IAB U.S. and China Mobile Report 2014 finds that a whopping 71 percent of China's mobile-toting consumers watch full-length TV shows straight from a smartphone or tablet on a weekly basis. Only 28 percent of U.S. respondents said the same. Seventy-six percent of Chinese consumers used smartphones while on public transportation, and 49 percent pulled out their phones while in cars. Only 26 percent of Americans used their smartphones on public transport (likely because many buses and trains still lack Wi-Fi) while 64 percent used phones while in cars.  And 91 percent of China's users play with mobile ads monthly versus 62 percent of U.S. users.
