Google s High-End Pixel C Tablet Launches to Tepid Reviews: In September, Google surprised us all when it announced its Surface competitor, the 10.2-inch Pixel C Android tablet with its optional Bluetooth keyboard. Unlike its Nexus line of tablets, this is the first time Google has built its own tablet. If you re willing to pay the price   starting at $499 for the 32GB model plus another $149 for the keyboard   the Pixel C is a very nice, solid tablet that sits atop the current crop of Android tablets. At that price, it directly competes with the iPad Air 2 (though the basic model of the Air only comes with 32GB of storage space). The Pixel C is now available in the Google Play store in a select number of countries. You can now buy it in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland. If you think this tablet/keyboard combo sounds a little bit like a Microsoft Surface, or maybe even Apple s iPad Pro with a keyboard, you re not alone. It s impossible not to compare the C with them. While Microsoft s Surface is essentially a fully featured laptop with a detachable keyboard, Google and Apple are opting for a combination of a tablet and mobile operating system with a keyboard. There is a market for the C, but I think it ll be a small one. The Pixel Chromebooks were meant to show what you can build when you don t cut corners to keep the price down   the C is meant to showcase what that would look like for a high-end Android productivity tablet. It s the Android Tablet for the CEO   assuming your CEO uses Android.
