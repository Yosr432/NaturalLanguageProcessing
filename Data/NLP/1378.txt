Google Unveils New Chromecast, Other Devices to Connect Smartphone and TV: Google on Tuesday revealed two new Chromecast streaming devices   one for televisions, another for speakers   along with a new tablet computer and a pair of new devices from the company s Nexus line of Android mobile phones. Much like Apple, Google is pushing a future where televisions become a vessel for the Internet and channels are replaced with apps. But instead of having separate devices for music and TV, Google has tried to position the mobile phone as the center of everything   a kind of remote control for life.Enter Chromecast, Google s popular streaming device that beams content from mobile phones to TVs via the Internet. The idea is pretty much the same as Apple TV, but Apple TV costs $149 and is essentially a small computer with lots of storage for apps to run on a television. Chromecast costs $35 and is just a waypoint between TVs and phones. The field of streaming devices has become crowded   Amazon and Roku make similar products. To distinguish itself from those stick-shaped competitors, Google s new Chromecast is about the size and shape of a silver dollar. Google also announced that it had sold 20 million Chromecast devices and that it was now compatible with thousands of apps, including Netflix and HBO Now. For a company whose spotty hardware record includes Google Glass, the much-maligned Internet glasses, and Nexus Q, a streaming device that was never released, Chromecast is a huge success. So Google is expanding it. On Tuesday, the company also announced Chromecast Audio, a new line of Chromecast devices that plug directly into speakers and receive music sent from a phone. Google simultaneously announced a new partnership with Spotify, the popular music-streaming app that is in a battle with Apple s new Apple Music offering.
