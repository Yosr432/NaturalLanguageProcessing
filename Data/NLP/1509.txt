YouTube gets super serious about gaming videos: Enter player two: YouTube stepped into the world of game-streaming Wednesday with the official launch of YouTube Gaming -- its answer to Amazon's popular gaming site, Twitch. The new section of YouTube allows gaming companies and everyday gamers to share live or recorded videos about the games of the moment. It also gives YouTube an official home for video game content as the business of watching other people play video games continues to gain popularity. Google first announced it would launch YouTube Gaming early this summer, ahead of the industry's big Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show, known more widely as E3. The debut comes a year after Google lost a bidding war with Amazon to buy Twitch, the Web's current leader in video game streaming. Amazon bought Twitch last August for nearly $1 billion dollars. Twitch is Google's main competition here. But YouTube isn't starting from scratch: it already has a huge amount of gaming content across its site. The company boasts "billions" of views across its site and says that time its users spend with gaming videos is up 75 percent in the past year. ZEFR, a technology firm that crunches YouTube data, estimates that videos of the walkthrough genre of what is known as "Let's Play" has garnered 40 billion views in the lifetime of YouTube.
