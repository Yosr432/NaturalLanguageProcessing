As Quick as a Taylor Swift Tweet, Apple Had to Change Its Tune: Taylor Swift s victory in a one-day battle against Apple this week showed she has a rare power to influence the music business itself, at a time of deep anxiety among artists big and small about the value of their work. On Sunday morning, Ms. Swift wrote a diplomatic but stern Tumblr post taking Apple to task for not paying royalties on test drives of its new streaming music service, set to open on June 30.  We don t ask you for free iPhones,  she wrote.  Please don t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.  By midnight Sunday, Apple   one of the most powerful companies in the world   had capitulated to the 25-year-old pop star, saying it would pay royalties on all music for the three-month trials. One of its senior executives, Eddy Cue, even said he called Ms. Swift personally to give her the news. The backdrop to that decision was much more complex than the quick exchange might have indicated. For more than a week, independent labels around the world had been complaining about Apple s proposed terms, saying that even for 90 days, a big drop in revenue from Apple   by far the music industry s largest sales outlet   could be devastating. But even though Mr. Cue carefully noted in interviews that the company s decision had been made with those labels in mind, its hurried announcement late Sunday suggested that it was Ms. Swift s shaming that led Apple to change its tune.  She is the most powerful person in the music industry,  said David Lowery of the bands Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, and an advocate for artists  rights.  She is able to bring the debate to the mainstream.
