SoftBank is bidding to buy ARM for $32 billion   because everything s a computer now: apan s SoftBank is buying U.K.-based chip design firm ARM Holdings for about $32 billion, according to the FT. Why  Everything is a computer now, and ARM has been one of the winners of the mobile revolution. ARM designs chips   but doesn t actually make them   for a huge variety of devices. It dominates the market for smartphones   Apple is a big client, as is Samsung   and its chips shows up in other consumer gadgets, as well as more-industrial-like devices and  internet of things  sensors. The number of chips containing ARM processors reached almost 15 billion in 2015, up from about 6 billion in 2010.The move is a big one for SoftBank CEO Masa Son after his would-be successor, former Google executive Nikesh Arora, stepped away from the company last month. (Talks presumably started while Arora was still there.) One key question is whether other firms will let SoftBank purchase ARM or if there will be a bidding war. Apple, arguably ARM s most important client, and Intel, which lost the mobile chip war to ARM, are both potential buyers.
