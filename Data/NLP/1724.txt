Capital One s String of Mobile Acquisitions Turns Into a Monsoon: It was somewhat surprising last year when Web design firm Adaptive Path was acquired by banking company Capital One. But the bank hasn t stopped there. On Wednesday it is announcing it has also scooped up Monsoon, a 40-person mobile development shop based in Oakland, California. Capital One won t say how much it is paying for Monsoon, but said it is in line with other acquisitions of similarly sized firms. As for why it is buying Monsoon, Managing Vice President Skip Potter said the company has a lot of ideas on how to revolutionize banking with mobile apps but needs more workers than it could simply hire on its own. Capital One, best known for its credit card business, has been trying to attract a new generation of banking customers who prefer powerful apps over physical branches. It has opened a handful of cafes in big cities such as San Francisco, but even there the focus is on helping customers get familiar with the brand as opposed to handling individual transactions.
