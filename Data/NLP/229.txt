Snapchat embraces offline purchase ad targeting: Snap will now allow advertisers to use Oracle s Data Cloud (formerly Datalogix) third-party data about what users buy offline to target ads on Snapchat, according to The Wall Street Journal. Snap tells TechCrunch that this rolled out over the last few weeks, and will allow targeting to 100 different customer demographics like  cosmetics shopper  or  consumer tech shopper. Yet the ad targeting based on what people buy at the grocery store that Snapchat is now offering fits that bill. Spiegel was talking about retargeted ads for specific products you looked at online. But offline purchase targeting will also produce ads that have users wondering,  How did they know I buy that    How Snap s new ad targeting works - First, Oracle Data Cloud collects data from retail stores about what you buy. Normally the company offers thousands of different demographic profiles and even specific brand buyers that businesses can target, but Snapchat has whittled that down to 100. These include  men s clothing buyer  or  car shopper.  All uploaded user IDs and email addresses are hashed for privacy, encrypted and anonymized, and Snap matches them to its users. Snapchat advertisers can then ask to target one of these segments of users and measure their impact on offline purchases, and they buy the ads through an auction or directly from Snap. It s currently testing the targeting system with brands like Honda, Kia and The Honest Company.
