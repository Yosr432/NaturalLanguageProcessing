Chinese government backed hackers mounted attacks on Apple  The press (NYT here, Washington Post here) has been agog with reports that Chinese authorities have been involved in a sophisticated cyber-attack on Apple. A sophisticated cyber-attack has targeted Apple s iCloud service in China, in an apparent attempt to collect user names, passwords and other private information as the company releases its newest round of iPhones in the world s most populous country. The attack, first reported on Monday by Greatfire.org, an activist group that monitors Internet censorship in China, was confirmed Tuesday by Apple.  The group speculated that China was hoping to collect user names and passwords for iCloud because the newest iPhones will include a strong new form of encryption that governments will have a difficult time cracking, limiting their ability to monitor the communications of its citizens. Google has also reported significantly increased levels of Chinese government interference this year.
