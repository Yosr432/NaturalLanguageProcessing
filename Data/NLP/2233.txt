Another CFO retires (after Google, Apple, Amazon) : Uber CFO steps down: Brent Callinicos, the chief financial officer of Uber, plans to leave the ride-sharing company, in what will be one of the highest-level departures yet for the six-year-old start-up. Mr. Callinicos s departure comes just two years after he joined Uber, according to an internal memo to employees obtained by The New York Times, where he helped the company expand from a young start-up to span more than 53 countries. The move comes on the heels of a spree of fund-raising activity for Uber. It also comes amid a spate of chief financial officer retirements at some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley over the past year. But perhaps most important, Mr. Callinicos s departure comes shortly after Uber arranged a private sale of convertible debt, managed by Goldman Sachs. The terms of this offering, as described by people briefed on the matter, give Uber an incentive to go public within the next few years. The securities being offered to Goldman s clients can be converted into stock   at a discount of roughly 20 to 30 percent of Uber s valuation in an initial stock offering.
