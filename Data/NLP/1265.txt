Google Says Chromebooks and Chrome Operating Systems Aren t Going Away: Rumors of the demise of the Chrome operating system have not just been exaggerated but are simply untrue, Google said on Monday in a rare public response to an earlier report. A report on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal claimed Google is preparing to merge its Chrome OS, which powers the Web-centric Chromebook laptops, with its mobile OS Android. After the story landed, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google s SVP who runs both Android and Chrome, pushed back on it, tweeting that the company is  very committed  to the desktop operating system.
