Competitors react cautiously to Facebook's moves: Kelly Kramer, Cisco s chief financial officer, downplayed the risk to Cisco, and pointed to strong sales of its Nexus family of switches in its most recent quarter. She noted that Cisco was also a member of the Open Compute Project, to  better understand where our customers are going.  Juniper is more actively supporting the open approach. In December, it submitted a design for a new switch called the OCX1100 to the Open Compute Project. If accepted, any OCP member could build the machine or write software for it. Arista Networks Inc., a fast-growing supplier specializing in data center switches, is the most threatened by the open approach, given that it gets a high percentage of its sales from a few large cloud providers, according to Jason Noah Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Co.
