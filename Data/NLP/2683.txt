Production and delivery bottlenecks are crimping Xiaomi's growth - but its India focus has only intensified - will make locally, and launch Redmi Note in offline stores as well: Instead of expanding into 10 new markets this year, Xiaomi will enter just five. That means consumers in Brazil, Russia, Thailand, Mexico and Turkey will have to wait a bit longer. The problem  Production and delivery bottlenecks are slowing the no. 3 smartphone maker's pursuit of Samsung Electronics and Apple. In the past two months, Beijing-based Xiaomi has had to charter special flights four times to make scheduled deliveries into India. While Xiaomi usually relies on commercial cargo flights for deliveries, the company can't always get the space it needs to meet demand, Manu Jain, head of operations in India, told reporters in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon yesterday. Hence the charters. The solution for Xiaomi is to produce its smartphones in the countries where it wants to grow.  Production in India will likely begin in one to two years, and Brazil may start sooner, he said. While Xiaomi has pushed back the expansion plans for some markets, India will be a "focus" for years to come, said Barra. The company has sold more than half a million of its low-cost phones in the country since expanding there in July. Xiaomi is on track to cross one million smartphone shipments in India this quarter and could break into the nation's top-five smartphone vendor rankings, he said. "Like Chinese consumers, Indian consumers are quickly warming up to bigger screens on their devices," Shah said. "Redmi Note will provide that power boost for Xiaomi to quickly move up the rankings capturing market share away from the incumbents.".
