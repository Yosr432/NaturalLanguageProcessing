Why Flipkart has turned to Kalyan Krishnamurthy: New CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy s main objective will be to make the budding Flipkart turnaround last. On Monday, Flipkart said Krishnamurthy, who was parachuted to the company for a second spell only last June, will replace Binny Bansal as chief executive officer (CEO) of Flipkart, exactly one year after Binny had replaced Sachin. Binny will become Flipkart group CEO. Ananth Narayanan, CEO of Flipkart s fashion units Myntra and Jabong, and Sameer Nigam, CEO of Flipkart s payment unit PhonePe, will continue reporting to Binny. Krishnamurthy will now control all of Flipkart and report to Binny. Krishnamurthy s elevation marks a major landmark for the start-up ecosystem: he has become the first so-called professional CEO at a large Indian start-up.
