Narrative Science can now describe your Tableau charts for you: Tableau Software s shares soared 13 percent on Tuesday following the announcement that the data analytics provider has partnered with Narrative Science, a Chicago-based company that develops natural language generation (NLG) tools. The result of the partnership is Narratives for Tableau, a free Chrome extension that automatically creates written explanations for Tableau graphics. Let s say, for example, that you have a chart   made with Tableau   of sales and profits of your business for a certain amount of time. The extension, which works with Tableau Server 10.0 or the free Tableau Public service, will generate a narrative description of the data by writing sentences such as  Sales and profit ratio moved in opposite directions from January 2011 to December 2014,  as shown in this example. Narrative Science is best known for Quill, a platform that can take data   say, sports scores   and turn them into stories. Narratives for Tableau is one example of applying Quill s capabilities, Frankel pointed out. Once Narratives for Tableau has generated the text, users can customize it by choosing a paragraph- or bullet point-style for the description, among other things. If users are not satisfied with the results, they can also make changes to the text.
