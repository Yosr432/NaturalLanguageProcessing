Alibaba's efforts to position 12/12 as another Singles Day (focused on Taobao) seem to have met with only mixed success: Alibaba has tried hard to position Double 12 as a similar shopping bonanza to Singles Day. Last year, it promoted the day heavily on Taobao and flooded other online and offline channels with advertisements. Taobao bought most of the internet portal traffic, and  12/12  signage saturated billboards and bus stops. After stressing that the nature of December 12 is different from November 11, Alibaba has kept the traffic and revenue results from the past two Double 12s on the down-low. The lack of numbers released has led many to believe that Double 12 s results didn t live up to Alibaba s initial expectations. The reason for the underwhelming sales  Hard to say for sure, but there are many theories. First off, it s been just a month since Singles Day. Retailers  inventory and consumers  budgets may not be sufficient enough to take part in the 12/12 extravaganza. Also, it s possible that the two-thirds of Taobao retailers that didn t take part in Double 12 ran out of inventory or turned to offline sales channels for the rest of the holiday shopping season. Retail logistics make it harder for smaller companies on Taobao to be as flexible on price as the big dogs on Tmall. They also can t offer up the same kinds of amazing bargains Chinese consumers are now accustomed to.
