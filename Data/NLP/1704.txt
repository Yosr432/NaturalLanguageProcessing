In a Major Shift of Emphasis, Out-Gunned Rackspace Seeks Growth in Microsoft Cloud Partnership: Rackspace Hosting will sell support services to customers running on Microsoft s Internet-based Windows Azure service, in a major shift of emphasis for the cloud-computing company. The partnership announced Monday means people can pay the San Antonio, Texas-based company to set up, manage and support technology rented from Windows Azure, or for support services on top of their existing Microsoft cloud deployments. Rackspace will continue to operate its own web-hosting and cloud services supported by its data centers and will let customers mix and match their IT between the two companies  facilities. The shift is part of a broader one for Rackspace as it seeks to make more money out of its support organization. Revenue growth slowed the past two years to about 17 percent annually and the company s stock fell the most in eight months in May after it released a second-quarter sales forecast that was below analysts  estimates. Rackspace support services will start at $1,500 per month, Engates said, and customers should save from 40 percent to 70 percent by using the company s services rather than doing the same support tasks in-house. Microsoft is the first of multiple partners. Providing support services on top of Amazon.com Inc. s market-leading Amazon Web Services cloud is  the headline  of the strategy, Pichler said. Larger cloud companies have outspent Rackspace on infrastructure for the best part of a decade. Microsoft spent $5.5 billion on capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 2014, compared with $435 million for Rackspace. The three companies each deploy millions of servers, versus the estimated 100,000 that Rackspace has under management. While Rackspace generated $1.79 billion in 2014 revenue, Amazon s cloud subsidiary, for example, brought in $1.57 billion in its most recent quarter, up 49 percent from a year earlier.
