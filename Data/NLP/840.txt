Beyond Swipe Right: The Pickup Line Gets a Makeover: Thanks to the popular dating app Tinder, a one-size-fits-all gesture of approval, swipe right, has in theory replaced awkward fumbles at an opening conversational gambit. But in fact, the migration of courtship online has resulted in a refinement of pickup lines far beyond  70s singles-bar relics like  Hey baby, what s your sign   and  Are those space pants  Because your butt is out of this world.  The simple  Hi  and its variations are the surest ways to end a conversation; they re too generic and, lately, indistinguishable from the way bots initiate contact. Only those with the most flattering profile pictures can get away with generic questions like  How was your weekend   A more common approach in Tinder-land is to quickly skim the other person s profile and find something to comment on   a detail from a photo, or a line of profile text. Statements tend to work better than questions as conversation starters; they re less personal and invite reactions and commentary rather than disclosure. With the help of a friend, Brent Bailey, 24, a programmer in New York, came up with a successful opener to someone who mentioned her life being  a bit messy  in her profile.  I could make your life a whole lot messier,  he responded. Mr. Bailey said he was more successful with crowd-sourced pickup lines.  As a rule, my friends are way less concerned about my dignity, so they usually come up with something way more interesting than I would,  he said. On the dating service Bumble, where women must initiate all conversations, Ms. Smothers decided to try what she called a  dumb troll-y  gimmick   asking every match if he was a feminist. Men loved it, and she got a high response rate she has yet to match.
