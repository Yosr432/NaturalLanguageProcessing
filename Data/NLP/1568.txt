Alibaba Skids as Revenue Growth Slowest in Three Years; $4 Billion Stock Buyback Is Planned as Stock Plunges 5% to New Low: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's shares fell to a record low after China's biggest e-commerce company posted its slowest revenue growth in over three years as its strategy to shift more services to mobile devices hurt advertising sales.

Revenue for the three months through June rose 28 percent to $3.27 billion, well below forecast. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) -- the total value of goods transacted across Alibaba's platforms -- rose 34 percent to 673 billion yuan ($105 billion), also the slowest growth in more than three years.
