Twitter Experiments With Engagement Stats Directly In Tweets: Want to know just how many people actually care about what you re tweeting  A new Twitter experiment spotted by ex-Twitter platform head Ryan Sarver will show many you how users are clicking on the links in the updates you post, with a handy link directly in the expanded Tweet view in the iOS application. As usual with Twitter s features, this is limited to a small sample pool of users at first, but could roll out more widely if deemed successful. At the bottom of the tweet view, for those with this feature enabled, you ll see a  View Analytics Details  link, which takes you directly to a synopsis of the overall interaction with said tweet, including overall impressions, and  engagements,  which includes how many people actually clicked on a link you shared, how many expanded the tweet and more.
