HTC Plummets to Decade Low on Loss Forecast Five Times Estimates: HTC Corp. plunged by the daily limit after its forecast for a quarterly loss five times greater than estimates spurred analysts to slash their valuations of the stock. Shares dropped 10 percent to NT$63 in Taipei on Friday, heading for their lowest price in more than a decade. The smartphone maker s third-quarter loss will be NT$5.51 to NT$5.85 per share, compared with expectations for a loss of NT$1.17 per share. Its sales forecast given Thursday is as much as 48 percent below estimates. HTC plans to cut staff, reduce spending and slim down its product catalog as cheaper phones from Huawei Technologies Co. and competition from Samsung Electronics Co. further erode its market share. Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Cher Wang has stated she won t consider mergers, even as the company fell off the global list of top 10 phonemakers. Sales this quarter will be NT$19 billion ($600 million) to NT$22 billion, the company said, compared with estimates for NT$36.8 billion. Revenue at the bottom end of that range would be the lowest in a decade when figures were reported at the parent level. HTC will change its product strategy to produce fewer models over longer time intervals while focusing on a greater share of industry profits instead of shipments, Chief Financial Officer Chang Chialin said Thursday. Cost reductions will start this quarter, with the result of those cuts being shown in the first quarter, he said.
