In China, digital ad spend will overtake TV next year, amid a rapid jump to mobile advertising: Next year companies are expected to spend more money on digital advertising than on television campaigns in China. It is a stark shift from three years ago when nearly half of the advertising dollars went to television and just 14 percent went to digital, according to ZenithOptimedia, an advertising agency. China is also diverging from the United States, where television continues to dominate. Homegrown social media platforms in China are at the center of the push. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are all blocked in China, giving platforms like Tencent s Weixin   known as WeChat outside the country   and Sina Weibo an advantage.  I ve been here four years. In that time I m now on the third dominant social network   first it was Renren, then Weibo and now it s WeChat,  said Chris Jones, the executive creative director at the ad agency Wunderman in China. Weixin s particular quirk   that users communicate only with friends and contacts within their circle   has allowed companies to develop direct relationships with consumers. But it also poses a challenge since users have to first choose to include a brand within their Weixin network.
