Taking on Apple Inc, Google and Intel to Team Up with TAG Heuer on a Luxury Smartwatch: On Thursday, TAG Heuer, the Swiss watch company, announced that it was building a new smartwatch   a wrist computer, in essence   as part of a collaboration with Intel and Google. The companies made a joint announcement at Baselworld, an annual show in Basel, Switzerland, for high-priced watches and jewelry. The watch will be released later this year, but aside from that the announcement was light on specifics. No exact release date. Nothing about what it will do. No price. The forthcoming TAG Heuer watch will be designed and manufactured by the Swiss watchmaker. The technology bits will come from Intel s chip technology and Google s Android software.
