Traders bet on Twitter near-term gains as takeover chatter persists: Dick Costolo's decision to step down as Twitter's chief executive last week failed to stem the weeks-long slide in the company's shares, but options traders appear to be betting on a near-term rebound. The stock has shed more than a third of its value since Twitter reported first-quarter results in April. It edged up 6 cents to $34.62 on Thursday, after touching a year-low of $33.51 on Tuesday. Since May, open interest in calls, usually used for bets on the shares rising, has swelled at a faster pace than the open interest in puts. For every open put contract, 1.7 calls are open, the most bullish for this ratio since early March. Traders have bid up near-dated options, with the demand for upside reflected in options skew - the difference between expectations for volatility priced into puts versus calls. Normally, puts tend to have a higher premium relative to calls, because people are willing to PAY more to protect against risk of losses. For Twitter, calls have become more expensive than puts. "The upside skew in Twitter most likely reflects the possibility of an upside event between now and July expiration," Place said."It seems that everyone and their uncle is betting that Twitter will be bought by another firm"
