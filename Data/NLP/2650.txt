Yahoo's mobile efforts paying off; will overtake Twitter in mobile ads next year, move to 3rd after Google, Facebook: Yahoo is now projected to be the largest gainer of U.S. mobile-ad market share between 2014 and 2016, according to new data from EMarketer Inc. out today. Yahoo s mobile-ad slice will climb to 3.74 percent in 2015 and to 4.2 percent in 2016. While still tiny, it s enough to push Yahoo ahead of current number three player Twitter, which will have 3.69 percent market share next year and 3.8 percent in 2016. Google Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. (FB) remain the biggest U.S. mobile-ad companies, with 35 percent and 17 percent shares next year respectively. The numbers show how an effort by Mayer to marshal resources and refocus the company on mobile is starting to pay off, making Yahoo relevant in a digital-advertising area that s projected to reach almost $60 billion in the U.S. in 2018 from $19 billion this year. In October, Mayer broke out Yahoo s mobile revenue for the first time, reporting third-quarter sales of more than $200 million, with gross revenue in mobile set to exceed $1.2 billion this year.
