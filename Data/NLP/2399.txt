Consolidation: Rumors swirl that Uber is looking to buy Meru and Olacabs is looking to buy TaxiForSure: Uber now reportedly in talks to buy Meru while Olacabs is said to be eyeing TaxiForSure. For all we know these could be just rumours possibly meant to scupper independent fundraising plans of the individual ventures. Both Meru and Uber have denied the reports calling it untrue. Meru, a legacy radio cab firm  owns several thousands of cars. However, the business model can be easily pivoted by leasing out the cars to fleet ownership and management firms. What s more, it could hive off the car assets into another company which could be sold off to another firm thus separating the cars from Meru s balance sheet. This is exactly what Flipkart did when it separated the legal ownership of WS Retail, its single largest vendor. That would make Meru a marketplace like its other fast growing peers. Last year Meru s chief Sidharth Pahwa told us that around 60 per cent of the cars are not owned by the firm and that figure could well have got bumped up further.
