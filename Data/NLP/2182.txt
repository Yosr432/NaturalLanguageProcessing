Alibaba's money-market fund ended 2014 with $93B in AUM, but its phase of explosive growth might be over: Ant Financial, Alibaba s affiliated financial branch, revealed a few benchmark numbers for Yu ebao, the company s consumer-facing money-market fund. By the end of 2014, Yu ebao s user count hit 185 million, up more than four times the previous year s count of 43 million. The fund s worth in assets reached RMB 578.93 billion (about US$93 billion) by the year s end, marking a 200 percent annual increase. Ant financial also claims that Yu ebao s funds generated RMB 24 billion (about US$3.8 billion) in value by year s end, amounting to RMB 139 per person. While these numbers appear massive from a birds-eye view, not all is peachy keen for Yu ebao. The fund s size shrunk to about US$87 million last autumn, and while these latest numbers appear to show a rebound, its days of rocket growth seem to be over. Yu ebao is the shell and banner for a money market fund run by Tianhong Asset Management. Alibaba s Ant Financial purchased a majority stake in Tianhong in late 2013 for a reported US$192 million. Yu ebao is accessible directly in Alipay Wallet, the mobile app for Alipay, Alibaba s third-party payment software. Yu ebao marks Alibaba founder Jack Ma s attempt to enter consumer banking. In the past, the ecommerce mogul has been vocal about his disdain for China s banking industry, wherein banks typically give consumers low interest rates for opening savings accounts. China s tech giants don t like to get one-upped, and other leading internet firms have also opened money-market funds similar to Yu ebao. Tencent operates Licaitong, an analogous money market fund, and recently opened what has been described as China s first  internet bank.  Baidu also has its hat in the ring, as does Xiaomi, which recently launched a money-market fund in beta.
