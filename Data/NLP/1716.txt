IBM Discloses Working Version of a Much Higher-Capacity Chip: IBM said on Thursday that it had made working versions of ultradense computer chips, with roughly four times the capacity of today s most powerful chips. The development lifts a bit of the cloud that has fallen over the semiconductor industry, which has struggled to maintain its legendary pace of doubling transistor density every two years. Intel, which for decades has been the industry leader, has faced technical challenges in recent years. Moreover, technologists have begun to question whether the longstanding pace of chip improvement, known as Moore s Law, would continue past the current 14-nanometer generation of chips. Each generation of chip technology is defined by the minimum size of fundamental components that switch current at nanosecond intervals. Today the industry is making the commercial transition from what the industry generally describes as 14-nanometer manufacturing to 10-nanometer manufacturing. Each generation brings roughly a 50 percent reduction in the area required by a given amount of circuitry. IBM s new chips, though still in a research phase, suggest that semiconductor technology will continue to shrink at least through 2018. The semiconductor industry must now decide if IBM s bet on silicon-germanium is the best way forward. It must also grapple with the shift to using extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, light to etch patterns on chips at a resolution that approaches the diameter of individual atoms. In the past, Intel said it could see its way toward seven-nanometer manufacturing. But it has not said when that generation of chip making might arrive. IBM also declined to speculate on when it might begin commercial manufacturing of this technology generation. This year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said that it planned to begin pilot product of seven-nanometer chips in 2017. Unlike IBM, however, it has not demonstrated working chips to meet that goal.
