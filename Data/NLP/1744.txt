Reports that Amazon is trying Special Price Discounts on Prime, possibly to challenge Jet, the Hot Discount Shopping Site: The last time the companies run by Jeff Bezos and Marc Lore squared off, there were fireworks. We re about to see what happens the second time around. The first time, Amazon instigated a pricing war with Lore s company, Diapers.com, ultimately pressuring it into a $550 million sale to Amazon. It wasn t exactly the outcome Lore was hoping for, but was a pretty good exit nonetheless. Now, as Lore s new, members-only shopping site Jet.com preps for its public launch, there are some signs that Bezos once again doesn t plan to sit aside idly. In the last few months, Amazon has been offering discounts on different products as exclusive deals for members of Prime, its two-day shipping and streaming media program. Last week, reports surfaced showing that Amazon was giving special discounts on video games to Prime members. Amazon has sporadically offered special discounts to Prime members in the past, such as exclusive discounts on Vizio TVs dating back to 2013. But the timing of the current set of discounts across multiple product categories could have to do with the fact that Jet, which is operating in private beta currently, is also a membership program built on the idea of discount pricing. For $50 a year, Jet is promising its members the best prices on the Web thanks to a complex system of discounting by stripping costs out of the order fulfillment and shipping process of e-commerce.
