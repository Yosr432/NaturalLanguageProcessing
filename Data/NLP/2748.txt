Groupon also had a positive earnings report (Q3 revenue $757M, 27% Y/Y, net loss $21M); firm is hanging in there tenaciously with many new products:  Groupon managed to best expectations, but not by a margin that investors found too compelling. The company is up 1% in after-hours trading. Groupon in the last quarter has been continuing its efforts to build out its product portfolio and continue developing its services in a bid to boost its traffic and offset any declines that it may see in daily deals. That has included the launch of individual business pages to rival those of Yelp, a shopping loyalty and couponing app called Snap, and a more flexible model for how it lets businesses list deals based on specific times of day to improve footfall. It s slowly making some progress on these fronts. The company says that 100 million people have now downloaded its mobile apps globally.
