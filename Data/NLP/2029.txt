Tencent shares surged to an all-time high this month after the operator of the WeChat messaging service posted a jump in online advertising revenue. Hong Kong equities rose to levels not seen in seven years, boosted by Chinese investors buying through the Shanghai trading link.  Tencent s valuation may look expensive but it s still acceptable compared with peers in the mainland,  said Sam Chi Yung, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Delta Asia Securities Ltd.  They have new opportunities such as advertising on WeChat as well as e-commerce initiatives that may become growth engines.  Tencent advanced 43 percent this year and traded at 50 times trailing earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the mainland, tech stocks have soared, with valuations at an average 211 times reported profits. That compares with an average multiple of 156 for U.S. companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index in March 2000. Tencent posted record net income of 23.8 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) for 2014 as Chairman Ma Huateng found new ways to make money from instant messaging and online gaming through advertising and payment services. Profit is expected to increase to 29.9 billion yuan this year and 38.4 billion yuan in 2016, according to analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Tencent released an operating system for smartphones and smartwatches Tuesday that provides voice recognition and includes payment systems. It s been steering shoppers to partner JD.com Inc. and expanding its game lineup to compete with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Tencent is trying to reach more users with deals to stream content such as HBO s  Game of Thrones  and to make WeChat among the first applications integrated with Apple Inc. s smartwatch.
