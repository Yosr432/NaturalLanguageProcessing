Why Health Care Start-Ups Like Theranos Need Investing Expertise: The Silicon Valley start-ups that often grab headlines are typically in the Internet and consumer technology world. But there s another part of start-up land that is also highly active: health-related technology, which includes biotech, health care services and medical devices. Venture capitalists have been pouring money into health-related start-ups, with funding jumping 34 percent to $9.4 billion in 2014 from a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. What s often left unsaid about these companies is that they behave very differently from the typical consumer start-up or business software company. The health-related start-up sector has produced fewer unicorns, which are the private companies with $1 billion-plus valuations, largely because it takes a long time to develop new medical tests, drugs or insurance systems. Regulators often weigh in. Even if an idea behind a start-up is truly great, it s bound to fail if the science doesn t work out, if the regulators don t like what they see, or if insurers and the government won t pay for the product.
