India's efforts to attract electronics manufacturing are finally gaining some traction: General Electric Co. and Nidec Corp. are among companies looking to take advantage of a subsidy India is offering for electronics manufacturing amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi s push to boost economic growth. The government has received at least 60 applications, with about half of them approved, for a subsidy of as much as 25 percent on capital investment, Ajay Kumar, joint secretary in the Department of Electronics & Information Technology, said in an interview in New Delhi. More than 40 submissions were made after Modi took office in May, he said.  The subsidy is a very good investment scheme that existed before Modi, but it wasn t marketed very well,  Sunil Kumar, compliance officer at Nidec s Indian unit, said by phone.  The government machinery is functioning better than before.  India introduced incentives in July 2012 for new projects and for expansion in electronics manufacturing in industries such as telecommunications, automobiles, medical and semiconductors. It started accepting applications for subsidies from August 2013, said Kumar at the Department of Electronics.  Suddenly with the emphasis on Digital India, electronics makers know there ll be more demand for their products,  said Kumar.  Now, practically on a weekly basis applications come in.  Jabil Circuit Inc., the maker of electronics for Apple Inc. that got approval for its investment proposal in June, plans to double its revenue from a factory in the western city of Pune making products including television set-top boxes, Sunil Naik, operations manager at the India unit, said by phone. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based company, which plans to invest as much as $20 million, has already spent $6 million.
