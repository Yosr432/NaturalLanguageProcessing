GoDaddy's IPO to value web-hosting company at up to $2.87 billion: Web-hosting company GoDaddy Inc's initial public offering is expected to value the company at up to $2.87 billion, and comes at a time when there has been a steep fall in the number of companies going public in the United States. Including debt, the company could be valued at $4 billion. The IPO market has had a slow start this year compared with 2014 when U.S. IPOs raised about $93 billion, the highest since 2000. Only two technology companies have gone public this year including online data storage provider Box Inc, whose shares have dropped about 27 percent since the company's market debut in January. GoDaddy was acquired in 2011  by a private equity consortium led by KKR & Co LP and Silver Lake Partners LP for $2.25 billion, including debt. It has since expanded from its roots in Internet domains to provide services to small and medium-sized businesses such as website building and web hosting. The company, which serves 12.7 million customers, is led by Blake Irving, who was Yahoo Inc's chief product officer from 2010 to 2012. GoDaddy's revenue rose 22.7 percent to $1.4 billion in the year ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier. Net loss narrowed to $143.3 million from $200 million.
