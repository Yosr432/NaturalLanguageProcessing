Twitter launches Twitter Offers, Which Link To Your Credit Or Debit Card; Separately Twitter's CFO commits a DM Fail: Companies will be able to offer cashback rewards in their tweets, and those rewards will tie directly into consumers  credit and debit cards. The card-based approach should offer some significant advantages. If you see an offer in your timeline (to use the example in the screenshot above, it might be $2 back on a $5 purchase at a coffee shop), you should be able to add it to your card without leaving Twitter. Then when you go into the store, you don t need to change your behavior   instead of bringing a coupon, you just pay with that card and the cashback payment should show up on your statement shortly after. A Twitter spokesperson said the card integration was already built by CardSpring, which Twitter acquired in July.Meanwhile, this gives businesses a way to track when their Twitter ads are actually driving consumers to make purchases in the store. From a security standpoint, Twitter says your card information will be encrypted and can be removed from your account at any time. Twitter Offers are being tested initially on desktop and mobile in the United States. The post says Twitter will be working with  a handful of brands  to test these offers in holiday-related promotions, and it will announce those brands  in the near future.
