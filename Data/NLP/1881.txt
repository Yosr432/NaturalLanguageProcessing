Apple is planning to introduce its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, to Britain this summer, The Telegraph reported on Saturday, citing industry sources. Apple is expected to make the announcement on Monday in San Francisco at its annual conference for developers, the paper said. The Telegraph said the iPhone already contains a wireless microchip similar to those found in contactless payment cards, which will allow Apple Pay users to pay by waving the handset over a terminal to pay. Transport for London, the paper said, was already accepting Apple Pay from American tourists.
