Uber Sells $24M Stake to India s Times Group in Marketing Deal: Uber Technologies Inc. said the publisher of India s most-read English newspaper has taken a small stake in the ride-hailing application company as part of a strategic partnership to support its expansion. The investment made by Times Internet is worth about 1.5 billion rupees ($24 million), the Indian company said in an e-mailed reply to a question. The Economic Times newspaper, also published by Bennett, Coleman, had first reported the value of the deal citing people familiar with the transaction. The deal with Times Internet Ltd. will help increase the marketing and distribution of Uber s services to more than 200 million consumers in India, the San Francisco-based company said in a statement on its blog, without giving details of the investment. Times Internet is a fully owned unit of Bennett, Coleman & Co., the flagship company of the Times of India Group and publisher of The Times of India newspaper. Uber counts India as its biggest market outside the U.S. and the fastest growing globally. Baidu Inc., China s largest Internet search engine, in December agreed to invest in Uber and said the company will connect its map and mobile-search features with the ride-hailing service. Uber s service is available in 11 Indian cities and offers three types of cars, including hatchbacks for as little as 7 rupees (11 cents) a kilometer.
