Mother-Son Team Demo Translate For Code: Meet Roslyn Scott and Dalton Scott, a mother and son team who just demoed a neat idea for making code more accessible, here at the Disrupt London 2015 hackathon. Their hack, called the Human Code Project, uses several IBM Watson APIs, including its Natural Language Classifier, to power a search interface for translating JavaScript code terms into plain English. It s designed much like a language translation interface, so someone who s trying to understand what a piece of code is doing can search for a particular Javascript word or phrase within that code to see a definition of what a term such as  onclick  might mean in that particular context. The interface returns a percentage breakdown of how confident the system is in its definition for that term. During the hackathon they uploaded a training document to Watson, and created two classifier sets   one for definitions of code terms and one for phrases, explains Roslyn.
