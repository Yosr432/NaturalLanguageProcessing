Uber's China Rival Says Cash Burn Has Slowed With Lower Payouts: Didi Kuaidi, the ride-hailing service competing in China with Uber Technologies Inc., said it has slashed the subsidies it pays out to drivers and riders since the middle of this year, reducing its cash burn as the rising number of orders reduce the need for enticements. The level of financial incentives last month were about a third of the level in June and July, Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy and head of taxi services at Didi Kuaidi, said in an interview in Beijing on Tuesday. Some of its services like taxi-hailing are close to breaking even, he said. The decline in subsidies comes as the transport ministry released draft guidelines that prohibit Internet ride-booking companies to offer their services below cost in order to gain market share, describing such tactics as disruptive to  normal market order.  The proposed regulations also codify requirements that vehicles used in hailing services must be registered for commercial use and that drivers have to obtain qualifications before being allowed to ferry fares.
