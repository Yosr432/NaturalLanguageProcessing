Zumper: One-Third Of San Francisco s Rent Is Attributable To VC Funding: Zumper, a venture-backed startup that focuses on creating a more efficient and transparent apartment rental marketplace, ran a study of housing costs in tech hubs across the United States. They re arguing that one-third of San Francisco s rents are attributable to venture capital funding. Last year, venture firms invested $49 billion across the United States. The vast majority of it, or 78 percent, went to just 10 American cities. The company looked at 3 million active listings across the United States last year. The study, done by the company s housing economist and MBA student Andrew Duboff, isolated for factors including population, median household income, median home values, rental housing vacancy rates, and impact of local rent control ordinances. The Zumper study did not account for zoning regulations.  It was tough to isolate an apples-to-apples comparison for zoning regulations, so we ended up not including it,  said Devin O Brien, who heads up marketing for Zumper.  That being said, vacancy rates does include a lot of this as a secondary measure. However, at the end of the day, we had an adjusted R-squared correlation of 0.83 for venture capital investment. It s very strong.  Another study last year from UC Berkeley economics professor Enrico Moretti and University of Chicago s Chang-Tai Hsieh argued zoning regulations are incredibly costly to the American economy. They found that if highly-productive cities like New York City, Boston and San Francisco had a more elastic housing supply, it could add 9.5 percent to the U.S. GDP.
