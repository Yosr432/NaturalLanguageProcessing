Foxconn Starts Manufacturing Smartphones in India Amid Modi Push: Foxconn Technology Group started making its first smartphones in India as part of the Taiwanese company s plan to expand in the South Asian nation. Production has started in Andhra Pradesh state in the nation s south east, Foxconn spokesman Louis Woo said, declining to comment further. Models for clients Xiaomi Corp. and InFocus Inc. have started shipping from a facility in Sri City according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it s not been officially announced. Foxconn is looking to expand in India amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi s drive to boost manufacturing in Asia s third-largest economy. Billionaire chairman Terry Gou, whose business empire gets half its revenue from Apple expects to open as many as 12 factories and create one million jobs in India by 2020, Foxconn said in a statement citing Gou. FIH Mobile, Foxconn s phone manufacturing unit, expects to have multiple manufacturing sites in India, with none employing more than 10,000 people, the company said in May.
