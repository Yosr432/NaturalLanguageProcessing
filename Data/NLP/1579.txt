After Surprise drop in Exports, China Unexpectedly Weakens Yuan Reference Rate by Record 1.9% Amid Slowdown: China weakened the yuan s daily reference rate by a record 1.9 percent, allowing depreciation to combat a slump in exports. The currency dropped an unprecedented 1.2 percent to 6.2848 per dollar as of 9:43 a.m. in Shanghai, and slid a similar amount in Hong Kong s offshore trading. The onshore spot rate was 0.9 percent weaker than the reference rate of 6.2298, within the 2 percent limit allowed by the People s Bank of China. Monday s reference rate increase was a one-time adjustment, the PBOC said in a statement, adding that it will strengthen the market s role in the fixing and promote the convergence of the onshore and offshore rates. It said also that it will keep the yuan stable at a reasonable level. The yuan s effective exchange rate is stronger than that of other currencies, which is a deviation from market expectations, the central bank said. The comments come after the PBOC said earlier Tuesday that a strong yuan puts pressure on exports. China s overseas shipments fell 8.3 percent from a year earlier in dollar terms in July, well below the estimate for a 1.5 percent decline in a Bloomberg survey.
