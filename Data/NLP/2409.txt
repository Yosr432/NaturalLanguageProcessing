..even as Netflix plans to raise $1B in borrowing despite a ratings downgrade: Netflix today said it plans to offer $1 billion in senior notes and plans to use the proceeds for  general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.  Markets are not entirely thrilled with the move. Netflix s stock is trading down slightly, and S&P has downgraded the company s debt rating to B+ from BB-. S&P notes that Netflix already has $9.5 billion streaming content commitment as of December 31, 2014, up from $7.3 billion a year earlier.  We expect that streaming content commitments will continue to increase and that Netflix s pursuit of more original programming with global rights will increase its cash flow deficits,  it concludes.
