IBM reports worst revenue in 14 years, shares slide: IBM on Monday reported a 21 percent decline in net profit from continuing operations, to $2.3 billion in the first quarter that ended March 31. Its operating earnings per share fell 19 percent, to $2.35 a share, though that was above the average estimate of Wall Street analysts of $2.09 a share, as complied by Thomson Reuters. The company s first-quarter revenue declined 5 percent, to $18.7 billion. But that was ahead of analysts  consensus forecast of $18.29 billion. After adjusting for the impact of currency translation, revenue was down 2 percent. IBM shares fell about 5 percent in after-hours trading, a retreat from a recent uptrend for the stock. In the first three months of this year, IBM s stock price had increased 17 percent. IBM delivered a quarterly performance that shows the steady headway it is making in new businesses led by cloud computing and data-analysis software, like its Watson artificial intelligence technology. But the company s transformation remains very much a work in progress. The erosion of some of its hardware and software products continues to be a drag on growth and profits, overshadowing the gains in the new fields.
