Bose gets into the hearing aid headphone business: When you ve got a punny name as good as  Hearphones  (no Google, I did not mean  headphones ) in the chamber, you owe it to the world to deliver product. For Bose, the emerging space of hearing-assisting headphones was the perfect place for that fun bit of word play. The company s newly unveiled earbuds seem to occupy a similar spot as a number of emerging bits of hardware, including Nuheara s IQbuds, which we described as a cross between a headphone and a hearing aid when we saw them a while back. Ditto for the Hear One and Sony s MDR-1000x noise canceling headphones, which were unveiled back at IFA. Bose didn t do a big announcement this time out, like it did with its new pairs of QuietComforts earlier in the year, instead opting for a soft unveiling, along with some in-person trials, which are running between now and the 15th at its Framingham, Massachusetts headquarters.
