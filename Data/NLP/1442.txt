Jet.com: Taking Off, Full Throttle. Respected seller blog ChannelAdvisor reports - "Jet has gained altitude so rapidly that it s currently our number 4 marketplace by GMV, out of the marketplaces we support worldwide. That means that just a month after its public debut, it s already bigger for ChannelAdvisor than incumbents like Sears, Best Buy, Newegg, Tesco and Rakuten   marketplaces that have been operating for years (check out the growth of these marketplaces here). It s not out of the realm of possibility that in 2016 it will be our number 3 marketplace, after Amazon and eBay. That would be remarkable. Just a few weeks after officially launching, the average Jet seller GMV is twice that of seller GMV on Sears or Newegg. Our sellers have seen tens of thousands unique consumers buying on Jet since its public launch, and a 23% repeat buyer rate. Over the same time period, eBay had a 17% repeat buyer rate and Amazon had a 11% repeat buyer rate. This indicates early shoppers on Jet find the values compelling enough to come back more frequently than on eBay and Amazon, although our sample size is still small."
