Apple Pay gets a vote-of-confidence from the US government: Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced on Friday a major new merchant for the company's mobile payment solution: the U.S. government. "Starting in September, Apple Pay will be available for many transactions with the federal government, like for example when you pay for admission to your favorite national park," Cook said at a White House organized cybersecurity summit at Stanford University. The company is also working with the government to make procurement cards issued to government employees for expenses compatible with the system, he said. More than 2,000 banks have already signed on with Apple to bring the service to their customers, Cook said, and it is working with the financial industry to deploy the technology to help distribute state and federal benefit programs, including Social Security benefits.The full scope of Cook's announcement was a bit unclear, but a White House fact sheet released in conjunction with the summit said Apple, Visa, MasterCard, Comerica Bank and U.S. Bank were committed to making Apple Pay "available for users of federal payment cards, including DirectExpress and GSA SmartPay cards."  GSA SmartPay is the largest government payment program in the world, according to the General Services Administration   handling 87.4 million transactions worth $26.4 billion per year. That makes this a potentially big deal.
