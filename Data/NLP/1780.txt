Marketers Will Drool Over Facebook s New Signup Ads That Auto-Fill Your Email Or Number: Businesses desperately want your email address, but it s annoying to enter it on mobile. Cue Facebook s latest News Feed ads. A marketer can buy an ad asking for you to sign-up for a newsletter or request a sales call, and with two-taps you can auto-fill your email address, phone number, or other info you ve registered with Facebook. Facebook is testing these  Lead Ads  with a small group of businesses around the world to gain feedback before considering rolling them out. Google has tested similar contact form ads for years, but they always required users to manually enter their info. To make Facebook s ads privacy-friendly, Facebook won t just hand your info over. You have to click the call-to-action button like  Subscribe,  and then  Submit  your info once you ve reviewed what was auto-filled. Users can edit that info inside the ads, and businesses only get what s voluntarily submitted. From there, advertisers can only use the data in accordance with a mini-privacy policy they embed in the ad, and can t resell it to anyone else. Rather than ads that lead you offsite to fill out sign-up forms, it s pulling that experience into the News Feed, so when you re done, you keep right on social networking. Removing the click away and manual data entry could drastically boost conversion rates on these kinds of ads, making them easier to sell at higher prices.
