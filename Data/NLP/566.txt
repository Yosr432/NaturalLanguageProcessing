Amazon to Invest Additional $3 Billion in India, CEO Bezos Says: Amazon.com Inc. will invest $3 billion more to build its business in India, bringing the company s total pledged investment in the country since 2014 to $5 billion as it chases growth outside the U.S. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of the Seattle-based online retailer, announced the investment Tuesday at the U.S.-India Business Council s Leadership Summit in Washington, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to executives from U.S. companies.  We have already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue to see huge potential in the Indian economy,  Bezos said in a statement from the council.  Our Amazon.in team is surpassing even our most ambitious planned milestones.  Amazon gets most of its international revenue from the U.K., Germany and Japan. The company doesn t break out sales from India, instead including it in a group with other international markets. Revenue from that group in 2015 reached $7.4 billion, or 6.9 percent of total sales. Amazon has targeted India as an area ripe for growth, and has been spending to challenge local e-commerce company Flipkart. Bezos said at a conference last week that Amazon is doing most of the last-mile deliveries and opening more distribution centers in India. Bezos also highlighted achievements in India in his annual letter to shareholders. They included the launch of Seller Flex, which uses Amazon sellers  warehouses to store other products sold on Amazon, helping the company quickly expand its delivery capabilities. Amazon s cloud computing division is also developing new infrastructure in India.
