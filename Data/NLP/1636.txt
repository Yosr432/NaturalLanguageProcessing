Akamai forecasts revenue, profit below estimates; shares sink: Online content distributor Akamai Technologies forecast third-quarter revenue and profit below estimates, citing a stronger dollar. Shares of Akamai, which claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, fell as much as 13 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The company's second-quarter profit fell nearly 8 percent after 11 quarters of growth, as costs rose. Akamai, whose customers include MTV Networks and online home rental marketplace Airbnb, forecast an adjusted profit of 56-58 cents per share and revenue of $543 million-$555 million for the current quarter. Akamai and rivals Limelight Networks and Level 3 Communications face increasing competition as companies such as Amazon, Netflix and Comcast enter the content delivery market. Akamai has been trying to differentiate itself by investing in cloud security services, as well as investing to expand its content delivery platform to better handle rising video traffic. Revenue rose 13.6 percent to $540.7 million, beating the average estimate of $540.4 million. Overall net income fell to $67.2 million, or 37 cents per share, from $72.9 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Up to Tuesday's close of $73.65, Akamai's shares had risen about 17 percent this year.
