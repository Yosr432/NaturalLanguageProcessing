Will It Be a Summer of Consolidation in Ad Tech  AOL could just be the beginning as rumors fly. Verizon's $4.4 billion purchase of AOL spark a summer of acquisitions in the ad-tech space  It depends on whom you ask. Yahoo has reportedly considered making Foursquare a big offer in recent weeks. The Google-purchasing-Twitter chatter has gone on for months and won't die. Yelp is reportedly entertaining suitors from Yahoo to Google and Amazon, with some analysts speculating that foreign companies Alibaba and Rakuten are in the mix. Even mighty Salesforce.com has found itself the subject of speculation about a Microsoft takeover. Rich Guest, president of North American operations, Tribal Worldwide, said the Twitter-to-Google hubbub makes the most sense. "I think that there were first rumors of an AOL-Verizon tie-up during CES 2015, which gives credence to the school of thinking that believes 'where there is smoke, there is likely fire,'" Guest explained. "Twitter is an amazing platform, which could add value to the product portfolios of many media or technology companies. Given all of the rumors of a Twitter-Google tie-up, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened sometime in 2015." MediaCom CMO Stephanie Fierman said, "I think many expect a transaction involving Yahoo at some point in the foreseeable future."
