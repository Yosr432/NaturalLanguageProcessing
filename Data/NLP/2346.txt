Reports that Snapdeal close to raising $400M at valuation of $4.5B - Alibaba apparently not in on the deal: Snapdeal.com, is in talks with new investors, including international hedge funds, to raise $400 million in a fresh round of funding, a person privy to the development told Techcircle.in. This round could see the estimated valuation of Snapdeal increase to $4.5 billion, more than doubling since October. Sources said the rumoured deal between Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Snapdeal is not on. Snapdeal already counts eBay as a strategic investor in the company. In October last year, Japanese telecom and internet firm SoftBank Corp (which is the single largest shareholder of Alibaba) committed $627 million (Rs 3,846 crore) in Snapdeal. This is the third biggest fundraising round by an Indian e-commerce firm ever, after Flipkart s record $1 billion funding round early in 2014 which was followed by another $700 million round later during the year. That round also included funding from other existing investors. Snapdeal has raised around $1 billion to date, the bulk of it in 2014 itself.
