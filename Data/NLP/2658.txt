Tumblr adds action buttons - simpler than Twitter buy button, but no payment integration: Tumblr, which has apparently overtaken Instagram as the fastest-growing social media property   has today announced a test of a new feature that will give it more interactivity, and more of a social commerce spin. Users that post links from a selection of sites   Etsy, Artsy, Kickstarter and Do Something   will now automatically see action buttons appear in the top right corner of the posts for people to  buy ,  browse ,  pledge , or  do something . For now, the actions are limited to these four sites. Down the road, if Tumblr decides to integrate the buttons into links from a wider range of properties   taking in e-commerce behemoths like Amazon and eBay, for example   it could feasibly become much more of a competitor against the likes of Pinterest, Facebook and others, positioning Tumblr not just as a place to consume content but to transact, too. the buttons on Tumblr are somewhat reminiscent of the buttons that Twitter has been adding to Tweets,but Tumblr s buttons are much more simple for anyone (not just businesses or power users) to create   they come up literally when you a copy/paste of a link. And while Twitter has integrated with payments companies to underpin its own buy button, Tumblr s implementation is, well, a bit more rough and tumble. It s unclear, for example, if Tumblr is getting an affiliate cut on any traffic that it sends to these sites as a result of the button. If anything, it feels more like Tumblr has added these buttons to test the waters, looking at how such a feature might potentially get monetised in the future, perhaps as an ad unit for businesses using the button. The offering is desktop only   not mobile.
