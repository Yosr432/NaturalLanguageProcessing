Quick win for companies on customer support  Pay attention to tweets of complaint: Two new reports   one from cloud-based customer care software maker Freshdesk, and another from tech research firm Gartner   suggest that even the top global brands are doing an amazingly poor job of engaging with their customers on new age channels like social media and mobile. Freshdesk looked at the top 100 brands of 2014, according to consultancy firm Interbrand, and analyzed how they engaged with customers on Twitter during the week leading up to the holidays: December 15   22. And this is what it found: The top 100 brands on average responded to just 22 percent of tweets directed at them. These 100 brands each got 1,000 tweets a week on average, but only 37 of them have a dedicated handle to listen to customers.  There were exceptions to this, but mostly in America   Samsung Support USA which goes by the handle @SamsungSupport responded to nearly all their tweets, as did @AskAmex for American Express, while @AdobeCare responded to a tweet in 26 minutes on average
