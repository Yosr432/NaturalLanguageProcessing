Amazon rolls out a new feature that lets you "make an offer": The feature is only available for certain items such as sports memorabilia, entertainment collectibles and its coin and fine art section. But those interested in buying those items can submit their bids to sellers to get what they want -- a part of the online commerce world normally associated with eBay. All in all, the company said in a release, around 150,000 items on the site have the flexible pricing options -- a number that should expand in 2015, Amazon said. The program isn't designed to send prices sky-high, as with eBay and other auction site listings, however. In a press release, Amazon says that the "Make an Offer" option give consumers a new option to "buy items at even lower prices." Sellers will indicate that they're willing to sell their item for less than a listed price, giving consumers the option to argue the price down, rather than try to outbid each other. Buyers and sellers negotiate over e-mail, where they can propose, accept, reject or counter each others' offers.
