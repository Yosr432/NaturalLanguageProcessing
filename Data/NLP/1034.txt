Parallels Between Netflix and Amazon: Netflix has grown substantially over the last few years, now claiming more than 70 million subscribers who pay about $8 to $10 a month for access to a large library of movies and TV shows. Last year the streaming service s stock was the best performing of the Standard & Poor s 500-stock index, rising 140 percent. And its prospects keep looking brighter: Last week, Reed Hastings, Netflix s goateed chief executive, announced he would make his movies and TV shows instantly available to almost every country in the world (the big exception, for now, is China). The move nearly doubled Netflix s potential market   the service is now accessible to more than 540 million households worldwide with broadband Internet access. On paper, Mr. Hastings s plan to take on the traditional TV industry has long sounded slightly nutty, as delusional as Jeff Bezos s strategy at Amazon to overrun retailing once seemed. Netflix s plan is certainly high risk   it is spending billions to create and license content, it is fighting determined media incumbents across the globe, and it owns none of the pipes leading into people s homes. (Among Netflix s many competitors is Amazon itself, which has its own growing and well-regarded original-content division) A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others.  Like Amazon, Netflix is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and it s using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. And finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.
