Oracle quarterly earnings: revenue $9.33B, 0% Y/Y. Shares up 1.7% on dividend hike, strong PaaS revenues: Oracle Corp. reported fiscal third-quarter sales that missed analysts  estimates, hurt by a rise in the U.S. dollar and weak corporate demand for cloud software. Revenue in the period that ended Feb. 28 was little changed from a year earlier at $9.33 billion, and profit before certain costs was 68 cents a share, the Redwood City, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. On average, analysts projected $9.47 billion in sales and profit of 68 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Without the effect of the stronger dollar, revenue would have gained 6 percent, Oracle said, sparking optimism that the company is making headway with its push into corporate cloud services and sending the shares up in extended trading.  The software maker also boosted its dividend by 25 percent to 15 cents a share, up from the prior payout of 12 cents. The company last raised its dividend in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oracle shares rose 1.7 percent in late trading following the report and dividend increase. The stock fell 1.2 percent to $42.87 at the close in New York, leaving it down 4.7 percent this year. Third-quarter net income fell to $2.5 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $2.57 billion, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Combined sales in Oracle s cloud software, platform-as-a-service -- known as PaaS -- and infrastructure businesses were $527 million, up 29 percent from $408 million a year earlier. The company started disclosing cloud revenue in June. In the long term, Oracle s transition to the cloud should benefit the bottom line, Catz said on the conference call.  For every million dollars of license we sell, we expect to collect another million dollars of support over five years for a total of $2 million,  she said.  While for every million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over five years.
