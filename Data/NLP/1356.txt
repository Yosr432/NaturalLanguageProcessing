Adobe 2016 forecast disappoints, shares slump: Adobe lowered its profit forecast for 2016 below analyst estimates partly due to a strong dollar, sending its shares down as much as 13 percent in extended trading. The Photoshop maker said it expects full-year revenue of about $5.7 billion and an adjusted profit of $2.70 per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $5.93 billion and earnings of $3.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In 2013, Adobe forecast an adjusted profit of $3 per share for 2016. The company is expecting a $200 million hit on revenue as a result of the stronger dollar, and a $100 million hit as Adobe's "last material businesses are transitioning to ratable revenue." Adobe has been switching to web-based subscriptions from traditional licensed software to help attract more predictable recurring revenue.
