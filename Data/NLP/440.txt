Twitter still has revenue problems, and its stock is down big: Twitter reported Q2 earnings on Tuesday and investors aren t happy. The key issue is likely Twitter s Q3 guidance. The company says it is targeting $590 million to $610 million in revenue next quarter. Early analyst estimates pegged that number at $678 million, according to Yahoo Finance. So that s a big discrepancy.The stock was immediately down more than 10 percent on the news and seems to be hovering there.So here s Twitter s dilemma: CEO Jack Dorsey has effectively been in charge of Twitter for the past year, and it s clear that the company s growth problem is still a problem. On top of that, Twitter has now missed revenue estimates two quarters in a row, and significantly cut its Q3 guidance. So there s a clear revenue problem to go along with the growth problem. Not good. To state the obvious, this kind of production (or lack thereof) doesn t help Dorsey s case for running two companies (remember, he also runs Square). It also puts pressure on the board to consider broader options for the company, namely selling. Twitter is in the very beginning stages of trying to transition its business to look more like TV, but it doesn t have a lot of runway left.
