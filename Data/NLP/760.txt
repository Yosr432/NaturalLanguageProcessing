Alibaba Gives Shelter in Debt Storm as China Internet Bonds Gain: China s Internet giants are providing a haven for bond investors fleeing mounting default risks among the nation s state-owned enterprises. Investors are snapping up bonds from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., a bright spot in an economy growing at the slowest pace in a quarter-century. The rising demand also reflects a broader shift in China s economy away from smokestack industries toward private-sector services such as e-commerce, online finance and entertainment. Creditors have grown wary of state-backed firms after Moody s Investors Service cut its outlook on 38 of them along with the government in March. Dollar bonds from Internet firms have returned 4.2 percent this year, the nation s best-performing sector, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Alibaba s securities due 2034 have gained 9 percent since Dec. 31, while 2025 notes of Baidu and Tencent both returned more than 6 percent. Alibaba, China s biggest e-commerce company, has cashed in by raising $4 billion from loan bankers and Tencent, operator of China s most popular messaging services, borrowed $2.45 billion in December.
