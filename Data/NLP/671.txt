Free Code Camp survey reveals demographics of self-taught coders: If you ve ever wondered who exactly is signing up for all these free learn-at-home coding classes and tutorial websites, Free Code Camp (which is one of them) has kindly surveyed 15,624 users with regard to various basic demographics and some more code-centric items. Some of the stats are expected (few women   around 1 in 5 surveyed) and a few are surprising   for instance, only 18 percent said they d like to work for a startup. Thirty-eight percent don t plan on specializing in UX, backend stuff or other specific disciplines, which they might want to revisit later. And they re all over the world   mostly the U.S., with India a close second   but the long tail comprises 167 more countries.
