Facebook's shares fell 10% on forecasts of higher spending, lower growth, despite beating earnings expectations (Q3 rev: $3.2B, Y/Y 59%, net income $806M, Y/Y 90%). The firm forecast revenue growth of 40% to 47% in Q4 2014, down sharply from 59% in Q3. CFO Dave Wehner also warned that the social network is preparing for a 55% to 75% spike in expenses next year, when the world's largest social network intends to invest in Whatsapp, Oculus and other products that have yet to show a profit. Facebook declined to provide any estimates for its expected pace of revenue growth in 2015, adding to investor worries. "Giving expense guidance without giving revenue guidance is frustrating and spooking The Street," said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. "The multi-billion dollar question is what s revenue growth going to look like next year," he said.
