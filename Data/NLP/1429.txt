Snapchat is going to charge for extra replays. Snapchat announced a new plan for making money Tuesday   it's going to let you pay for extra replays. According to the company's blog, the ephemeral messaging service wants to let you get a tiny bit more permanent. Users already get one free replay per day, but now Snapchat will let users pay 99 cents for up to three additional chances to see a snap again. "We ve provided one Replay per Snapchatter per day, sometimes frustrating the millions of Snapchatters who receive many daily Snaps deserving of a Replay," the company said in an official blog post. "But then we realized   a Replay is like a compliment! So why stop at just one " According to Snapchat, the replays work like this: you can use a replay on any snap you receive but, crucially, can only replay any single snap once. To this point, Snapchat has made its money off advertising, and has not previously charged users for any part of its service. The company, which reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, has been valued at roughly $19 billion on private markets. But a recent report from Gawker, citing leaked financial documents, indicated that Snapchat had generated just $3.1 million in revenue last year.
