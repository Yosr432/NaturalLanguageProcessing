Who won, who lost in Square's IPO  Square s recent $2.9 billion IPO is either a huge win for its investors or a sign of very bad days to come, depending on whether you believe the  high-five  tweets from prominent venture capitalists (VCs) or the slew of hand-wringing articles   from sources like NPR, The Verge and the Wall Street Journal   essentially saying it marks the end of free-flowing startup capital.The wildly contradictory responses to Square s Nov. 19 debut on the New York Stock Exchange, when the payments-processing company s stock was priced below its previous funding round in the private markets, has left a lot of people in the startup community (and beyond) wondering what s going on. My take is that the IPO is further evidence that the new rules of the hunt for  unicorns    startups valued at more than one billion dollars   are creating a small class of  haves  and a much larger class of  have-nots.  The lucky ones are the earliest-stage investors that find tomorrow s unicorns. The less lucky are often the late-stage investors   generally the providers of the bulk of the capital   and the talent that signs on as these companies grow to fighting strength and scale. I think this is likely to cause a rebalancing of late-stage valuations and an increase in transparency in private markets.
