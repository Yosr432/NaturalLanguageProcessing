Google Fiber Is Finally Coming to San Francisco: Google Fiber is coming to its own backyard. Well, in moderation. On Wednesday, the high-speed broadband and cable business, announced that it will start servicing  some  apartments, condos and affordable housing units in San Francisco, the urban hub north of its Silicon Valley headquarters. It s not saying how many connections, when they ll come or how much they ll cost.But it is definitely coming, unlike other cities where Fiber has said that it is  exploring  an arrival. That makes San Francisco among the largest metropolitan areas for Fiber, which has, so far, kept to smaller cities clamoring for its service (and where it can more quickly gain broadband market share).It s a symbolic entry   landing near Silicon Valley   as well as a commercial one: The city is full of tech companies and techies that have also clamored for super fast Internet.Comcast* and AT&T, two of Fiber s chief competitors, have both announced intentions to bring gigabit Internet to the city. While Fiber has primarily focused on residential lines, it could expand into enterprise services, something Comcast has made a push for.Google is accelerating its enterprise business, which includes a team dedicated to getting startups on Google services. It s not clear if that includes Fiber, which is housed under the Access subsidiary of Google s Alphabet.
