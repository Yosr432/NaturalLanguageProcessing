New iOS malware should make you think twice about jailbreaking your iPhone: Information about the Apple accounts of more than 200,000 iPhone users who "jailbroke" their phones has been stolen by cybercriminals who could use the data to lock the phones and hold them for ransom, according to Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity research firm. The malware behind the digital theft, dubbed "KeyRaider," has "successfully stolen over 225,000 valid Apple accounts and thousands of certificates, private keys, and purchasing receipts," Palo Alto researchers said in a blog post. The stolen data appears to have been downloaded to an insecure server where hackers can easily gain access to it, the researchers said. The problem appears to be isolated to phones that were altered to bypass Apple's attempts to keep users safe. Apple keeps tight control over what apps are allowed on iPhones, running basic security tests before allowing them to be downloaded. But some iPhone users have bristled at such restrictions, and to escape them, some people "jailbreak" their phones -- taking steps to get around restrictions built into the devices so can they install things not available in the official App Store.
