What 25 hours in virtual reality feels like: A Los Angeles writer set a world record after spending 25 hours playing a single game in virtual reality. Derek Westerman, 32, took on the challenge after trying virtual reality for the first time earlier this year. Westerman was left wondering how long anyone could last in an experience that he considered intense and overwhelming. When Westerman found out there was no world record for time spent in a virtual reality headset, Westerman pitched the stunt to Super Deluxe, a maker of comedic YouTube videos. For the challenge Westerman spent the 25 hours making three-dimensional artwork in a game called Tilt Brush. Each hour Westerman would start a new painting, and shift between standing, sitting down or lying on the floor. Westerman, who ultimately said it was a great experience, hasn t worn a virtual reality headset since setting the world record a month ago. For 24 hours after the experience Westerman said that everything looked uncanny. Spending a day in virtual reality changed how his brain registered space. Objects in the distance looked odd, as if they weren t real. Human senses are capable of adapting well to new and different circumstances, according to University of Maryland professor Amitabh Varshney, who leads its virtual reality research efforts. Varshney recalled an experiment in which an Australian professor outfitted his assistant with glasses that inverted his vision, turning the world upside down. While initially confused, before long he was able to perform everyday tasks such as ride a bicycle.
