Apple Watch Sold Out Despite Scarce In-Store Crowds: (More here) Few people lined up at Apple Inc. stores from Beijing to New York to get a peek of the company s new smartwatch, while online pre-orders pushed delivery dates for some versions into July. The Apple Watch, a test of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook s ability to innovate, arrived Friday in stores in eight countries and Hong Kong for customers to preview. It officially goes on sale April 24, when delivery begins of devices that have been ordered. Delivery times quickly pushed passed that date, after Apple began taking online pre-orders about 3 a.m. in New York. By about 9 a.m. shipments of high-end versions, which can cost as much as $17,000, were delayed until June. All 10 versions of the entry-level Sport, which starts at $349, were delayed until June, according to the company s U.S. website. Mid-tier models were being promised for delivery in four to six weeks, with four versions stretching into June or July.  We view this as an indication of solid demand paired with very limited supply, with supply being the most significant limiting factor,  Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., said Friday in a note to investors.
