Alibaba Arm Eyes More Capital to Build China Finance Empire: Ant Financial, which dominates e-commerce payments in China, was said to be valued at over $40 billion in its latest round -- making it one of the world s largest private tech companies. It manages the nation s biggest money market fund Yu E Bao and is targeting smaller borrowers to tap a market overlooked by traditional banks. Investors may be drawn by Ant Financial s exponential growth. Since it began life as Alipay in 2004, the company has become the country s largest online provider of financial services, helped by its role as the preferred payment method across Alibaba platforms. It has since expanded into adjacent industries such as insurance and online credit. One of the more aggressive of China s new breed of online finance companies, Ant Financial s maneuvers have courted controversy in the past. Ma spun off Alipay into a new company he controlled in 2011, citing the risk of foreign ownership of domestic financial firms. Major shareholder Yahoo protested and said it was caught unaware.
