The confessions of a reformed technology evangelist - He was sure technology would save the world. Then he went to India. For a long time Kentaro Toyama was a believer in technological utopianism. He studied physics at Harvard and earned a PhD in computer science at Yale. Toyama went on to do research at Microsoft. The work was demanding, but something was missing. In 2004, when his boss asked if he was interested in opening a research center in India, Toyama accepted on the spot. He d never even been to India. But he was hungry to make more of a direct contribution to society. Here was the chance to sprinkle tech fairy dust on a developing nation and watch success after success. Except it didn t play out like that. The humans mattered a lot more than the technology, he found. Toyama settled on a new view of technology. It s an amplifier of human intentions, not a cure-all for human problems. For technology to be a part of positive change, the environment it enters must already be moving in the right direction. Toyama believes it s foolish to think education is about having content available to study.  The fundamental problem of education is not content, it s motivation. You have to find a way to help productively direct the motivation of the student,  Toyama said.  The idea that they can do this just because we have fed it to them online possibly through some fancy interactive graphic I think is just a crazy notion.  He notes how Thomas Edison thought the motion picture would revolutionize our education system.  Television was supposed to uplift millions,  Toyama writes.  Instead, millions sit in thrall to the Kardashians.
