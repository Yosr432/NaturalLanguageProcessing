Location-based audience targeting is used by 18% of US mobile retailers (set to double in a year);  Geo-location could turn help offline retailers fight back against online: In category after category, Amazon has steadily eroded the market share of traditional bricks-and-mortar retail chains, which seem to be in a state of irreversible decline. Much of the online giant s competitive advantage is based on its access to and mastery of rich customer data. Traditional retailers know relatively little about their customers, unless they have a loyalty card and actually buy something   and even this knowledge comes late, after a purchase is made. They have no way to cross sell, recommend new products, or target advertising. Unlike Amazon, they can t tell if a potential customer visits the store or passes by it without buying anything. But all that is about to change because traditional retail is starting to wake up to the potential of geolocation, which is giving the new wave of data analytics companies ways to help bricks-and-mortar retailers make up for the data deficit. A separate analysis finds that 18 percent of US mobile marketers plan to use iBeacon technology to target consumers this year. "We expect that to double next year," she said.
