Offline retailers bet on smart in-store tech: Neiman Marcus is reinventing the mirror: The retailer announced Thursday that it has installed a MemoryMirror from MemoMi in its Walnut Creek, Calif. store. It plans to install two in its San Francisco store later this month and then two in Dallas. The mirror* allows for shoppers to compare in real time how different outfits look on them. After trying on clothes in the fitting room, a customer can head to the sales floor where the special  mirror  is located. A customer controls the mirror with an iPad, instructing it when to start recording or take photos. Then he or she can try on additional outfits, and compare video footage. Two outfits can be looked at side-by-side, and the mirror stores as many clips as the customer wants. So a customer could try on a dozen looks, take videos of each, and quickly compare how each look. There s also the option to e-mail videos or photos to friends for their input, or share on social media. The MemoryMirror isn t technically a mirror, but a 70-inch screen with a camera on top that films the consumer. MemoMi founder Salvador Nissi Vilcovsky says the secret sauce is its perspective distortion correction, which automatically sizes  the mirror to fit the customer. So no matter if you re standing four feet in front of it or 10 feet away, it proportions the mirror so the customer fills the shot.  The world is going in the direction of in-store devices and personalization. We want to make these devices as cheap as possible and give these services not only for luxury brands,  said Vilcovsky. Nordstrom and Rebecca Minkoff have also dabbled in the smart fitting room space, using eBay technology. MemoMi is working on adding features to its MemoryMirror that allow a customer to see how they look in different colors or patterns of the clothes they re trying on. Vilcovsky also envisions one day technology such as this being available on consumers  televisions.
