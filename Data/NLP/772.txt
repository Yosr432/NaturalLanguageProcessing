WhatsApp completes end-to-end encryption rollout: It s a security project that s taken around a year and a half to complete, but messaging giant WhatsApp has now fully implemented strong end-to-end encryption on its platform and across all mobile platforms for which it offers apps. This means users of the latest versions of the messaging app will have their comms and media end-to-end encrypted by default. And there are a lot of WhatsApp users; earlier this year the Facebook owned company announced it had passed a billion active users. Securing cross-platform video comms was the last piece of the puzzle, according to a WhatsApp spokesman. End-to-end encryption means the content of communications are not stored in plaintext on WhatsApp s servers. Nor is the company able to decrypt users  messages to access them since it does not hold the encryption keys. So WhatsApp will be unable to be compelled to hand over messaging data   even if served with a warrant by authorities demanding access.
