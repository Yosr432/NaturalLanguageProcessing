Google launches Retail Search Ad with local inventory offering: Early success as Sears Hometown store visits jumped 122 percent: Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, a retailer fighting for every sale, has evidently found a weapon in Google's Local Inventory Ads that it says works to drive consumers to its stores. The digital marketing product is still fairly new from the search giant, launched last year, and holds the promise of finally helping brick-and-mortar brands take advantage of the online world rather than always getting beaten by it. With that in mind, the Sears spinoff company has been running Google's shopping ads that target by location and reveal whether a product is actually in a location. As part of a Google report today, the retail company claimed that such information has worked to generate 122 percent more visits to its 1,240 shops under the Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores brand. The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based chain's click-through rate was 16 percent higher on inventory ads when compared to other ad products. "The ad unit is terrific for a mobile experience," said David Buckley, CMO of Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores. "It's highly relevant to where you are, and it's served with an image, price attributes, and how far you're standing from that product. It's the ultimate search ad product for mobile. You can't ask for more than that."
