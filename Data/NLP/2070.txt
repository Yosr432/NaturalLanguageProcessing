Microsoft Cloud Strength: Azure revenue is $1.57B quarterly revenue A bright spot for Microsoft was the growth in its cloud business, a catchall category that includes Office applications that are sold as subscriptions and its Azure business, through which it rents computing capacity in Microsoft data centers to clients. The company said its commercial cloud revenue grew 106 percent during the quarter, and amounts to a $6.3 billion annual business based on its recent performance.  The company said its commercial cloud-related revenue for the quarter more than doubled, and was now running at $6.3 billion a year. Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday its quarterly cloud revenue rose almost 50 percent to $1.57 billion, suggesting a similar annual number. Microsoft's overall revenue rose 6 percent to $21.7 billion, above Wall Street's average forecast of $21.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Taking out the effects of the strong U.S. dollar on currency rates, Microsoft said revenue would have risen 9 percent. Earnings per share declined to 61 cents per share from 68 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected 51 cents, on average.
