Kobe Bryant Takes NBA Retirement News to Twitter, Not TV. Chris Sacca Is Pumped: On Sunday, outgoing NBA star Kobe Bryant opted not to make his expected retirement announcement on broadcast TV.

It took about an hour for Twitter to add the news to its Moments tab. (Facebook s trending section, at least for me, does not have the news, but is teasing a split between NFLer Tim Tebow and a former Miss USA over  lack of sex. )It took about an hour for Twitter to add the news to its Moments tab.
