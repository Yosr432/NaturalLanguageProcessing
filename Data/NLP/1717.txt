How to use Facebook s new News Feed controls: Facebook made a pretty big announcement Thursday, saying it will now allow users much greater control over what appears in their News Feeds. Prioritize whom to see first: There are a few things you can customize in the new menu, starting with telling Facebook which friends of yours should always be at the top of your news feed. Facebook calls this the "See First" crowd. Unfollow people to hide their posts: The next step gives you a chance to unfollow people whose posts may have been making you avoid the news feed. Reconnect with people you unfollowed: Facebook also gives you the chance to "Reconnect with people you unfollowed" if you're in a forgiving mood. Discover new Pages: This section is more or less a way for Facebook users to find the more professional pages on the site   those run by brands, celebrities or other public figures.
