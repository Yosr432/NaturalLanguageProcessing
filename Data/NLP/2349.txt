Chinese smartphone users consume surprisingly little data - 200MB/month; only about a fourth of the global average: China has about 520 million active smartphone users right now. Unlike in most of Asia s developing nations, China s smartphone market is mature and close to its saturation point. Despite all this well-established growth, China s smartphone users are still using surprisingly little data each month   in fact, they re using just a quarter of the global average. New numbers from China s tech ministry, MIIT, shows that mobile users in China now consume an average of 200MB of data each month (as spotted by Reuters). While that figure is going up, it s still way below the global monthly average of 819MB. China s mobile data usage has grown slowly from an average of 122.8 MB per month in mid-2013. 200MB is pretty small. It s the equivalent of downloading or streaming 50 songs or two short TV shows.
