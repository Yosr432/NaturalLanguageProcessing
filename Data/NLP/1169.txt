AppDynamics Raises $158M; Now Valued At $1.9 Billion: Last month, based on an SEC filing, we told you that seven-year-old, San Francisco-based AppDynamics had raised a fresh $83.4 million in funding as part of a round that was targeting up to $150 million. Turns out the company met that target and then some. CEO David Wadhwani   who joined the firm in September after spending more than a decade as an executive at Adobe, including as its digital chief   says the company has just closed on $158 million in a round led by General Catalyst and Altimeter Capital. Other participants in the round include Adage Capital, Industry Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and Cross Creek Advisors, as well as earlier backers Institutional Venture Partners, Greylock Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners. AppDynamics makes software to monitor the performance of business applications, competing with some traditional firms like IBM, as well as younger outfits like New Relic, which went public last December and has seen relatively steady stock performance since. (New Relic, which raised $214 million in venture funding, has a current market cap of $1.8 billion.) AppDynamics had previously raised roughly $206 million in debt and equity, including a $120 million round   $70 million equity and $50 million of debt   that closed in July of last year. At the time of the funding announcement, the company told VentureBeat that the money represented  pre-IPO growth financing.  Asked today what this new round means, Wadhwani said he  won t speculate on the exact timing  of an IPO but added,  I was brought in to take this company public, and that s what I intend to do.  The new funding, he said,  represents freedom. We can [execute on our plans for the company] on this money and effectively choose when we want to go public.  Wadhwani declined to discuss the company s post-money valuation, but a source close to the company pegs it at $1.9 billion.
