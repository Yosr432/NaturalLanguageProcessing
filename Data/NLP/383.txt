Ola shuts TaxiForSure unit, lays off up to 1,000 people: Cab-hailing company Ola has shut its TaxiForSure unit and is laying off as many as 1,000 employees, as the SoftBank Group Corp-backed firm tightens its belt to take on US-based rival Uber. According to at least half-a-dozen people with the direct knowledge of the development, about 90% of the staff being laid off from TaxiForSure works in the company s call centres, driver relations and business development units. The employees that are being retrenched are located across a dozen cities and are being given three months  salary as compensation, said the people mentioned above. These include current and former employees of the cab hailing company.Ola had acquired smaller rival TaxiForSure for $200 million in early 2015 to strengthen its position against Uber Technologies Inc. After the acquisition, Ola had centralized TaxiForSure s operations to three major cities Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi and eight smaller cities. The company kept around 250 employees each in the three metros and around 30 each in the eight other cities. The layoff and shutdown comes at a time when Ola is locked in a bruising battle with Uber that involved public spats and legal wrangling. It is also dealing with adverse regulatory environment in various states that affect its operations. The company has been trying for a large fundraise for quite some time. Ola has so far raised around $1.2 billion from investors including Japan s SoftBank Group Corp. The taxi-hailing firm was valued around $5 billion at the time of its last fundraising. Although Ola had initially planned to retain TaxiForSure as a separate brand, resource crunch seems to have forced the company to wind down the unit. The people cited above said that drivers on TaxiForSure have been moved to the Ola platform. The company has also been prompting TaxiForSure users to migrate to the Ola app in recent months.
