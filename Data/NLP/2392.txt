A sad day: RadioShack has officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Once a home base to the radio/homebrew/DIY geeks of the world, RadioShack devolved into a glorified cell phone store in the early 2000s. While they ve spent the last few years trying to find their roots with things like a dedicated section for Arduino gear*, they ve mostly failed to get bodies back in the store.
