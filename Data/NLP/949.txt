Facebook Disavows Marc Andreessen Comments on India, and He Apologizes:  Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and board member of the social network Facebook, has long been one of its vocal supporters. On Wednesday, Facebook did not welcome that support. Hundreds of users, many of whom said they were of Indian descent, reacted negatively to Mr. Andreessen s comment and what appeared to be his pro-colonialist sentiment. The tweet has since been deleted. Facebook swiftly swatted down Mr. Andreessen s comments on Wednesday.  We strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India,  Facebook said in a statement. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook s chief executive, also posted on the social network that he found Mr. Andreessen s comments  deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all.  He added that through his travels to India, he has  gained a deeper appreciation for the need to understand India s history and culture.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Andreessen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Andreessen posted new tweets in which he apologized for his previous comments, an apology he later repeated.  I now withdraw from all future discussions of Indian economics and politics, and leave them to people with more knowledge and experience!  he wrote.
