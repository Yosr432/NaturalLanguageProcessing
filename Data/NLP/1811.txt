China to promote cross-border e-commerce as incomes rise: China will increase support for cross-border e-commerce as the world's second-largest economy shifts from manufacturing to higher-value services, the government said. The government released policy guidelines on Saturday that include tax policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption and pilot projects to ease overseas payments. Chinese e-commerce firms will be given state support on international projects while credit insurance services will also be introduced. Customs will streamline clearance of goods and quality supervision agencies will allow collective declaration, examination and release of goods. There will be tax sweeteners on e-commerce retail exports and settlement of payments in yuan will be promoted, it added. The policy document followed Friday's announcement that China will allow full foreign ownership of some e-commerce business to boost competitiveness.
