Twitter Built a New Button So You ll Send More Private Messages:  Reply. Retweet. Like. And now Send. Twitter is adding a new button to the bottom of each tweet so that it s simpler to send that tweet to another user within a private message. The new icon, a small envelope right next to the heart-shaped Like button, automatically attaches the tweet to a private message which you can then address to another user.  But the fact that Twitter is putting a new button onto each tweet is a pretty good indication of how important direct messaging is to the company. Twitter was late to building out its messaging service and as a result has always lagged behind other messaging apps like Facebook s Messenger or Snapchat. But Twitter DMs are increasing in popularity   Twitter claims that 60 percent more messages were sent in 2015 than 2014. Adding a new button to encourage more private messages should bump that number even higher. It should also make it easier for users to send tweets to brands or retailers, a customer service use case Twitter is starting to build features for. It s one of the reasons the company removed the 140-character text limit for direct messages last summer; it s hard to have a conversation with a customer service agent when you can t send more then two sentences at a time. The customer service use case was also one of the reasons Twitter has considered spinning DMs into its own app. It ultimately decided against the idea.
