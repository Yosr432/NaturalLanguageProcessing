Intel s $16.7 Billion Altera Deal Is Fueled by Data Centers: Intel Corp. agreed to buy Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion to defend its presence in data centers, forging a deal that will add to a record year for industry consolidation. The world s largest chipmaker will pay $54 a share in cash for the maker of programmable logic semiconductors, Intel said in a statement Monday. That s a premium of 11 percent over Altera s closing share price on Friday and 56 percent from March 26, the day before the possibility of a transaction was first reported. Intel, like other chipmakers, is seeking to contend with growth and rising costs, while trying to defend its most profitable business. The largest deal ever in the $300 billion semiconductor business was announced last week when Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion. Acquiring Altera may help Intel defend and extend its most profitable business: supplying server chips used in data centers. While sales of semiconductors for PCs are declining as more consumers rely on tablets and smartphones to get online, the data centers needed to churn out information and services for those mobile devices are driving orders for higher-end Intel processors and shoring up profitability. Sales at Intel s data-center division rose 19 percent in the first quarter as Internet companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. built out their server operations. As a part of Intel, Altera will continue to support designs that couple its chips with others designed on ARM Holdings Plc technology. Companies such as Qualcomm Inc. are preparing to use that to try to break Intel s dominance in data-center chips, where it has more than 98 percent of the market.
