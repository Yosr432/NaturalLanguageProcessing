Amazon UI too cluttered for you  Canopy has a Pinterest like skin on Amazon for curated community-driven shopping, recommendations : Canopy offers a cleaner, uncluttered interface for its shopping service   a big difference from Amazon.com itself. In its community, you can browse through products recommended by other users, see what s trending, shop by category or brand, or even shop by personality type   the latter something that may come in handy as you struggle with your holiday shopping needs. Meanwhile, as you find products you like you can add these to collections within the app, which can later be accessed under your Profile section. Essentially, the service is like having a layer of curation overtop the massive Amazon.com catalog, presented in a more modern, almost Pinterest-like format.Canopy has seen around 22% average weekly growth in traffic over the past six months, says co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, and 35% weekly growth in gross revenue. (The company declined to go into detail on customer numbers or revenue figures, however.) Currently, Canopy makes money via affiliate fees, not product placements or ads, which has allowed the company to bootstrap its service to where it is today.
