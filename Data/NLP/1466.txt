One of Bollywood's biggest studios is betting it can win the online streaming race. Encouraged by an activist investor, the executive chairman of Eros International Plc is making its Eros Now streaming service a priority -- shelving a plan to create an old-fashioned television network to focus on video-on-demand optimized for mobile devices and priced for widespread adoption. The idea is to use the Mumbai studio s bulging catalog of more than 2,000 films and new, exclusive series to build a critical mass of devoted users before Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. plant their flags in the world s second-most populous country.  We thought,  We have the market share, we have the movies,   Lulla, 53, said in his London office on the city s Georgian-era Manchester Square, looking every bit the mogul in a crisp, open-necked white shirt and slip-on shoes.  Why don t we create our own platform   Thanks to a production machine built by his father Arjan, who founded Eros in 1977, it releases upwards of 70 movies a year -- more than any U.S. rival. Eros is  exactly where Netflix wants to be in the next three to five years,  Lulla said.  I m already there.   Since a largely marketing-free soft launch about a year ago, Eros Now has attracted more than 26 million users. The official hard-sell unveiling was in July, with promises that movies will be available to stream immediately after they hit theaters. Promotions tease new digital series including  Khel,  a drama about  the twisted characters that populate the world of cricket,  and  Ponniyin Selvan,  based on a 2,000-plus-page novel about an ancient Tamil kingdom. A basic, ad-supported tier is free, while premium services cost from 50 rupees (about 80 U.S. cents) to 100 rupees monthly. Prices are higher outside India, where there s opportunity in diaspora communities. In the U.S. it s $7.99 -- which happens to be Netflix s base cost.
