Parrot is laying off a third of its drone division: Drone makers are having a tough time competing with China s DJI. Parrot, the French drone maker, announced today it is planning to lay off one-third of its drone-related workforce   about 290 employees   after poor performance in its fourth quarter caused it to miss sales estimates by 15 percent.
