A Personality Profile of Larry Page: How Larry Page s Obsessions Became Google s Business: Three years ago, Charles Chase, an engineer who manages Lockheed Martin s nuclear fusion program, was sitting on a white leather couch at Google s Solve for X conference when a man he had never met knelt down to talk to him. They spent 20 minutes discussing how much time, money and technology separated humanity from a sustainable fusion reaction   that is, how to produce clean energy by mimicking the sun s power   before Mr. Chase thought to ask the man his name.  I m Larry Page,  the man said. He realized he had been talking to Google s billionaire co-founder and chief executive.  He didn t have any sort of pretension like he shouldn t be talking to me or  Don t you know who you re talking to    Mr. Chase said.  We just talked.  Larry Page is not a typical chief executive, and in many of the most visible ways, he is not a C.E.O. at all. Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O   an annual gathering where the company unveils new products   is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors. But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Google s various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.
