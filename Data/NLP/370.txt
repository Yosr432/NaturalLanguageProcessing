Former Flipkart CEO s Employee Clash Shows Indian Startup Trauma..: India s largest online shopping service is heating up, and not in a good way. Flipkart s regular Friday townhall grew tense after employees incensed by hundreds of job cuts openly accused management of betrayal. Taken aback, chairman Sachin Bansal countered that the departures stemmed from poor performance and he lost his job as chief executive for the same reason. The co-founder admitted the company had missed financial targets in recent months, prompting an overhaul of its top rungs, according to employees who attended the meeting. He didn t elaborate but recent moves -- including a brief decision to go mobile app-only after ditching its fashion site -- may have granted an opening to a hard-charging Amazon.com Inc. Bansal s unusual candor, which drew applause, underscores the plight of the country s technology sector as competition intensifies and funding begins to dry up.
