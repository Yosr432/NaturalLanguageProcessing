Ad Blockers Shoot to the Top of iPhone App Store Chart After Debut Day: After the inaugural day of Apple s latest operating system version, which permits new extensions for blocking content in Safari browsers, two apps that do just that shot to the top of the paid downloads. Peace, a $2.99 ad-blocking app created by former Tumblr engineer Marco Arment, currently sits at first place in the iOS paid apps, bumping Microsoft s Minecraft. A similar app, Purify, built by developer Chris Aljoudi, is at fourth place. A third, Blockr, is the 28th most popular, as of Thursday morning.The apps, once activated, strip ads and tracking cookies out of the Safari browser on iPhones, but not other browsers, like Google s Chrome, or within apps. Apple enabled them with iOS 9, which debuted on Wednesday. Publishers, particularly smaller ones, have worried that Apple s move may spark an uptick in mobile ad blocking, curbing critical display ad revenue. It has been less of a concern for big ad-supported tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, since their bread and butter, in-stream ads within apps, won t be affected by the blockers. Google, however, does make its cash from ads within the Web. The search giant has found a way to keep (read: paid for) its profitable text ads from being killed in previous popular content-blocking tools like AdBlock Plus. It s not clear if Google has worked out a similar fix for these new iOS apps.
