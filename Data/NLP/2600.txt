Google's launches "Store Visits", making it easier to figure out if online ads drove in-store traffic: The tech giant is rolling out a new tool today called "store visits" that gives marketers some insight into which types of search ads which include local inventory and product listings ads motivate people to go to a store. Google's store visits tool uses an algorithm to estimate how many people went into a store as a result of seeing an ad within 30 days. In turn, advertisers are given anonymous data (meaning that it doesn't pinpoint specific users) that is collected from smartphone owners who have turned on their location history. To qualify for the new tool, Google advertisers need to verify their location with the search giant and set up location extensions in an AdWords account. Store visit info is only available to U.S. advertisers and will gradually be rolled out within the next few months.
