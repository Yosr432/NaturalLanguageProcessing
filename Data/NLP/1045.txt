Zuckerberg Plea for Free Web in India Wins Support in Review: A majority of Indians who submitted comments to the nation s telecommunications regulator said they support Facebook Inc. s Free Basics plan that would allow free Web access. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said that 1.35 million responses in support of the plan -- or 56 percent of all comments -- came from Facebook s @supportfreebasics.in, according to a report on the agency s review of different pricing for data services. It received another 544,000 responses from @facebookmail.com, with most backing Facebook s plan, the regulator said, without providing a percentage. Comments either supporting or opposing differential pricing were  basically template responses" and "identical in nature," the regulator said Saturday on its website, without explaining how the views would be used in the review. The agency s chief, R.S. Sharma, told The Hindu newspaper in an interview published Jan. 1 that such responses were "not helpful at all" and didn t represent meaningful input. The regulator has appealed to respondents and Facebook to solicit more detailed opinions. Facebook Chairman Mark Zuckerberg made a personal appeal in one of India s leading newspapers last month for the country to allow a free Internet service. Facebook s proposed Free Basics plan allows customers to access the social network and other services such as education, health care and employment listings from their phones without a data plan. Industry groups say the program threatens the principles of net neutrality and could change pricing in India for access to different websites.
