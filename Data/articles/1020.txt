AMD revenue forecast misses market estimates:  Revenue fell 22.7 percent to $958 million. Advanced Micro Devices forecast first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates, due to lower demand for its graphic chips used in consoles and an economic slowdown in China. Shares of the company, which is in the process of selling some of its assets to cut costs, fell 7.7 percent to $1.80 in extended trading. AMD has been shifting to gaming consoles and low-power servers, but progress has lagged Wall Street expectations due to intense competition from Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp. China accounted for 42.2 percent of AMD's revenue in 2014. Revenue fell 22.7 percent to $958 million but still came above analysts' expectation of $954.7 million. Up to Tuesday's close, AMD's shares had fallen 13 percent in the past 12 months. The company's net loss narrowed to $102 million, or 13 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, from $364 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.
