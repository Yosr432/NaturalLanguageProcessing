Big news in the US TV Market: Dish to launch Sling TV, a web TV service: What is Sling TV  Sling TV is a service by Dish Network, one of the country's largest satellite TV providers. When it officially goes online in a few weeks, it will cost $20 a month. For that you'll get access to about 30 channels   including TNT, Cartoon Network and CNN. These channels will be streamable over the Internet   or "over the top," in industry parlance. But the real kicker is that Dish is throwing in ESPN (more on that in a second).
