Google s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes: Early during tonight s game, Google s ad for the Google Home aired on millions of TVs. We ve actually seen the ad before: loving families at home meeting, hugging, and being welcomed by the Google Assistant. Someone says  Okay, Google,  and those familiar, colorful lights pop up. But then my Google Home perked up, confused.  Sorry,  it said.  Something went wrong. This isn t the first time television has set off people s home assistants. A month ago, a TV broadcast accidentally triggered a whole bunch of Amazon Echos.
