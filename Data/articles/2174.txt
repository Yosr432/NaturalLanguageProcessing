BlackBerry Reports $28 Million Profit in 4th Quarter - business no longer on brink of collapse, but future still unclear: John S. Chen, executive chairman of the ailing smartphone maker BlackBerry, was again asking for patience on Friday after the company produced a surprise, but slim, profit while also posting an unexpected drop in revenue. The $28 million profit in BlackBerry s fourth quarter was mainly thanks to a patent sale and tax recovery. The company lost $106 million on an operating basis. For the entire year, the company lost $304 million on revenue of $3.3 billion. Despite the introduction of two new phones and a push by the company to sell software that allows businesses and governments to manage all of their employees  mobile phones regardless of their brand, fourth-quarter revenue was $660 million, down from $793 million in the previous quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of about $792 million. The revenue drop suggests that the company has yet to revive its phone business, said Brian Colello, an analyst at the firm Morningstar. During the period, BlackBerry offered two new phones: the Classic, which restored features found on older BlackBerrys, and the Passport, which has an unusual square screen. They were aimed at BlackBerry s traditional customers, like people in the financial industry. Neither has sold well. There was one bright spot. ITG Investment Research reported that retail data it collected in BlackBerry s home market in Canada showed that BlackBerry sales at Rogers Communications, the country s largest wireless carrier, rose by 27 percent in the final quarter of last year compared with the third quarter. Sales at Bell Canada were up 12 percent, but BlackBerry sales fell by 13 percent at Telus, the other large carrier in Canada. ITG added that  the solid quarterly trends seen at Canadian carriers may not be representative of global sales trends.  BlackBerry s software business rose by 24 percent over the previous quarter and 20 percent over the same period a year earlier. But Mr. Chen told analysts that an older version of the company s mobile device management software, which is more oriented toward BlackBerrys, was outselling the new version, which the company is promoting heavily. Although BlackBerry no longer appears to be on the brink of collapse, Mr. Colello said it was still unclear if Mr. Chen could now make his company grow while maintaining profitability.  The entire business is very uncertain at this point,  he said.
