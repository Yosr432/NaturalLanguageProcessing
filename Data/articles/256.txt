Mark Zuckerberg shares Facebook s secrets with all his employees, and almost none of it leaks: Unlike tech companies such as Apple and Snapchat, which keep employees in the dark about projects and ambitions, Facebook routinely shares all kinds of secrets with all of its workers at Friday afternoon Q&A sessions that Zuckerberg has been running for a decade. What s most surprising: Almost none of it leaks out. Sources say Zuckerberg uses these weekly meetings to tell his nearly 16,000 employees details of yet-to-be-released products, like news reader app Paper or Snapchat competitor Slingshot   and M, the AI assistant. He ll open up about the company s product strategy, like its push into live video. And Zuckerberg will also share his personal opinions on competitors like Snapchat and Twitter, and even Facebook s board members. Almost nothing is off limits. And almost nothing leaks to the press, even though Facebook s entire workforce   including its interns   have access to the meetings.  That level of transparency is alarming when you see it at first,  said one former employee.  But there s something [special] about knowing you re getting an unfettered response.  And that special feeling   that employees have access to information and an open, unscripted, says-whatever-he-thinks Zuckerberg   helps keep what happens at the weekly meetings inside the weekly meetings. Usually. "People come to work at Facebook because they want to work for Zuckerberg," said one former employee.  No one else has a Mark."
