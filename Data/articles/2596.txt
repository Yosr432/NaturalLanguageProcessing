Beacon-enabled mannequins are the latest in mobile app notifications:  We decided we had to work out a way to bring the good old-fashioned mannequin into the 21st century,  said Jonathan Berlin, the managing director of Universal Display, the company that is selling mannequins with electronic implants. About a year ago, Mr. Berlin and his partner, Adrian Coe, had an idea to outfit their product with electronic beacons, small transmitters that can communicate with your cellphone. Mr. Berlin and Mr. Coe created a separate company, Iconeme, just for the beacons, which interact with users through the company s app. Shoppers can see what a store s mannequins are wearing, who designed the clothes and how much they cost. But these can beckon you from outside the store, sending messages to your cellphones and beaming pictures of their outfits onto them. They are one of the latest efforts by the struggling retail industry to lure customers away from the Internet and back into brick-and-mortar stores. Don t feel like going through the store to find an item  You can even buy it through the app. Iconeme is not the only business trying to use technology to help people shop in stores. A company called MyBestFit created kiosks that quickly scan people s bodies, analyze a database of clothes and make suggestions. Iconeme s first beacon mannequin began in Britain in August. Since then, about 3,500 people have downloaded the company s app, Mr. Berlin said. Beacon technology is already popular with retailers along Regent Street, a high-end strip of stores in London, which already use beacons to ping shoppers with promotions and advertisements. He said three retailers in the United States were testing his products, but declined to disclose them, citing confidentiality restrictions.
