Messaging continues to rise as an eCommerce Platform: Line Launches A Taxi Booking Service In Japan Because Chat Apps Have Become Platforms Line Taxi is built into the existing Line app, just like its recently introduced payments service, and its launch pits the company against dominant player Uber and British rival Hailo. A messaging app integrating a taxi app might sound an odd pairing, but it has been done before. China s top chat app WeChat tied up with taxi on-demand service Didi Dache last year and there s been talk of Facebook Messenger integrating with Uber   a chat app launching its own taxi service is something unique, however. Line Japan has introduced taxi booking this week, but it also has plans for on-demand food delivery, it has its own maps app which could support online-to-offline commerce for retailers, and it is dabbling in social commerce too. There are also plans for a music streaming service   which will be global thanks to Line s acquisition of MixRadio from Microsoft   and more than 30 apps and games are tied into its core chat service. Line isn t alone in building out its messaging experience. WeChat is doing the same in China. This week parent company Tencent launched an online bank   WeBank   which is likely to become a focus of its messaging platform, alongside existing pushes into retail, payments, taxi-hailing and more.
