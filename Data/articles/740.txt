Regulators plan to revoke Theranos  federal license and ban founder Elizabeth Holmes: Theranos might find itself homeless soon. A federal agency plans to force founder Elizabeth Holmes out of her blood analysis startup for two years and take away the California lab s federal license. First reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a letter dated March 18 proposing sanctions barring Holmes and company president Sunny Balwani from owning or running operations in labs for at least two years   including in  both California and Arizona   and taking away federal licensing for Theranos  California facilities in Newark and Palo Alto after Theranos  continued failure to correct major problems with accuracy and competence. These actions would be a major financial blow to the startup valued at $9 billion. Theranos has the runway to keep working with approximately $700 million in the bank but the two labs make a good portion of the money for Theranos  operations and a loss of the founder and president would strangle any hope of recovery.
