Facebook video's success is scaring Google, causing Twitter to weigh autoplay: Since launching autoplay earlier this year, Facebook has been catching up to YouTube in views. In September, Facebook said it was showing 1 billion videos per day. The Twitter source, who has seen the latest numbers, said that figure has already grown to 3 billion. The insider added that the completion rate where viewers watch the entirety of a video is  mind-boggling,  suggesting that autoplay is a winning strategy and something Twitter ought to implement, even at the risk of upsetting some users. Meanwhile,  Google is freaking out,  said a media agency executive, as Facebook attempts to poach YouTube talent in order to improve the quality of its video offerings. YouTube has gone on the defensive with lucrative counteroffers in exchange for exclusivity. Twitter is divided over whether to allow videos to simply start playing when users scroll over them. It is a feature already adopted by Facebook, but one that scares Twitter purists who don t want it to stray farther from its text-based roots, according to industry insiders with knowledge of the company s video strategy.  It s an argument that s happening a tug of war,  said one.
