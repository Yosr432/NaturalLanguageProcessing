Companies - Including IBM and Cloudera - Are Moving On From Big Data Technology Hadoop: There is increasing evidence that Hadoop   one of the most important technologies of the past several years for big data analysis  is not keeping up with the world that created it. On Monday, IBM, which has champion ed Hadoop and put it at the center of its big data strategy, announced it is working on a faster data-processing engine, called Spark. Additionally, a senior executive at Cloudera, probably the largest Hadoop company, said Cloudera is prepared to see key parts of Hadoop diminish in importance, and was increasingly distributing Spark. Hadoop is an open-source architecture that drew heavily on work published by Google in 2004, in particular two different papers on managing, processing and generating very large data sets. Google s File System and MapReduce, the subjects of the two papers, were based on computing systems that were not organized around drawing a lot of computer memory in a short time; there just hadn t been that much data before. It did a good job, but it had inherent limitations, since it was adapting one style of computing to another. Spark, by contrast, assumes a world where digital information comes in massive volumes from web browsers, sensors, phones and other things. Does that mean old Hadoop is dead, and with it companies like Cloudera and Hortonworks  Not so fast   they may have been planning for this day.  We re already the largest distributor of Spark in the world, including Databricks,  said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer at Cloudera.  If MapReduce becomes less important in how people do big data, and it will, we will be there.  Cloudera, he said, has  reset in a smart way, ahead of the others,  by focusing on tools and services for other kinds of analysis besides Hadoop.
