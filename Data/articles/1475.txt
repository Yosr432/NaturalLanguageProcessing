Google Dreams of a World After Apps but It s a Nightmare for Rivals: With one search algorithm tweak this week, Google rekindled deep-seated fears that it is doing its damnedest to nuke apps. Maybe. Google earns more money when people are on the mobile Web, not in apps. Publicly, the company has voiced support for solving the nagging problems of apps, discovery and dormancy. Internally, however, chatter is less about crippling apps than imagining a world beyond them. Conversations with people inside and recently departed from Google reveal that the company is spending considerable attention on what comes after mobile apps, and how Google can usher that era in. A primary vehicle for doing so is app indexing and deep linking, methods to tie content within and between apps. Apple and a host of Silicon Valley startups are doing this as well. But Google s effort is unique in that it is wrapped tightly with search and artificial intelligence   and, like Google s approach to the Web, it is all-encompassing in its scope. There are some hints of how Google envisions mobile evolving beyond apps. Now on Tap, its feature launching soon in Android, inserts Google s personal assistant tech and search intel into apps that allow it, essentially allowing a more seamless transition from app to app on a phone. A chat in email about a movie, for instance, would jump quickly to the app of IMDB. Voice control plays a role in the app-less future, too. Several rivals, along with app publishers and ad sellers, interpreted Google s move this week as hostile.  It s basically Google starting to meddle with people s products,  said Alex Austin, CEO of Branch Metrics, a deep-linking firm. Austin noted that with Google s app indexing drive, it is pushing app creators to build mobile websites.  In an app world,  he said,  Google is nothing.
