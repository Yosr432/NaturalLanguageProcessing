Uber is seeking to raise an addition $1 billion from new investors, possibly at a $25B valuation, structured as a convertible debt offering: Coverage here, here and here: We ve heard the company is shopping the deal as a convertible debt offering, as opposed to a typical late-stage equity deal, with a valuation cap of $25 billion. Uber s existing investors include Benchmark, Menlo Ventures, Google Ventures, TPG Growth, Kleiner Perkins, Fidelity, Wellington Management, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Jeff Bezos, Lowercase Capital, and First Round Capital, among others. With the financing Uber is seeking to add to that list and is pitching new investors on the deal. For Uber, structuring its financing as convertible debt would reduce its risk of dilution, particularly as the company seeks to raise so soon after its last round. The company is already extremely well-capitalized, having raised approximately $1.6 billion to date. Uber was even tested as a delivery partner for Amazon, and there s a real possibility it could provide the framework for on-demand delivery of goods from other third-party providers in the future. All that is very capital-intensive, and Uber will need money to make money.
