Report suggests millions of Uber rides in China are fakes reported by drivers in order to collect Uber s high driver subsidies.: A new report on Chinese tech site Tencent Tech suggests that millions of Uber s booked rides in the country are fakes   fraudulent fares reported by drivers in order to collect Uber s high driver subsidies. Faking fares   which some drivers refer to as  acupuncture    works like this: first, you buy an Uber driver account. There are plenty available for sale on sites like Taobao, and many even come with helpful  how to fake rides  guides. Once you ve got your account, you partner up with a passenger using the consumer Uber app. With location services turned off, the passenger submits a fare from point A to point B. You drive the fare with no passenger, return the money paid by the passenger, and then split the driver subsidies Uber will pay you   which may be several times the price of the fare itself. This  acupuncture  phenomenon it doesn t only affect Uber. But drivers told Tencent Tech that because Uber s subsidies are the highest, virtually all of the faking right now is taking place on Uber s platform because it is the most profitable. Uber reportedly does have the technological capability to shut down fake rides entirely, but is concerned that doing so would slow its genuine organic growth because being overly strict could result in false positives, banning real drivers and passengers who aren t cheating the system.
