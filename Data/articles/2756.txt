Facebook engagement ticked up; but the firm sidestepped Snapchat-inspired questions on teen engagement: Facebook, already the world s largest social network, said it had 1.35 billion monthly users in September, up from 1.32 billion in June, and 64 percent of them used the service daily, up slightly from the second quarter. The firm however did not field the one question that could have instilled confidence or sent it into a death spiral: teen engagement. The company refused to break out any data about usage levels of teens, which are widely thought to be abandoning Facebook for apps like Snapchat. When asked about engagement for different demographics, Facebook s CFO David Wehner said the company had nothing to report on specific cohorts of users. That was probably smart. A year ago when ex-CFO David Ebersman said Facebook  did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens,  the share price plummeted despite an otherwise killer quarter.
