Apple Pay Seeks Growth in Asia, Europe After Slow U.S. Adoption:  After a sluggish start in the U.S. since its debut more than a year ago, Apple Pay is ramping up in markets where people are more comfortable with so- called contactless payments. The service, which lets consumers pay in an app or by tapping their iPhone on store terminals, will be introduced next year in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain. Apple is counting on its brand recognition as it enters markets that are further along than the U.S. in all things mobile payments, particularly in advanced technologies needed to accept them in retail outlets. Still, it won t be easy. The iPhone maker will compete with local banks and Internet companies that already offer the service -- not to mention Samsung Electronics Co., the world s leader in smartphones. The mobile-payment service, which only works with Apple devices, is a way for the company to make products more appealing and spur customer loyalty. After Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called 2015 the  year of Apple Pay  in January, the service has been slow to take off domestically, partly because of a lack of promotion and a limited number of store terminals able to accept it. China: Apple said its service will be rolled out as soon as early 2016.   Last week, Apple teamed up with Chinese bank-card association UnionPay, which will make Apple s market entry  a lot easier,  said James Wester, an analyst at researcher IDC. Still, Apple Pay will compete with services like Tencent s WeChat and Alibaba s Alipay that control more than 75 percent of the mobile-payments market. And Apple should be prepared to race with Samsung, which also announced a partnership with UnionPay and plans to bring Samsung Pay to China as soon as early 2016.
