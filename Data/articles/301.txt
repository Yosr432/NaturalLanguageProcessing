Andreessen in hot water for texts he sent Zuckerberg: Facebook s board was sued earlier this year, with investors alleging that their interests were not adequately represented when Zuckerberg was permitted to sell most of his shares and still retain voting control of the company. And now court filings uncovered by Bloomberg show that texts sent by board member Marc Andreessen are being used to suggest that he was protecting Zuckerberg instead of shareholders. Private messages sent during conference calls from Andreessen to Zuckerberg, such as  this line of argument is not helping  and  now we re cooking with gas,  have given some investors the impression that he was coaching the CEO instead of negotiating with him. The board appointed a committee last year to represent investor concerns because the proposed stock sale could dilute their voting power. Andreessen was on the committee and has been accused of neglecting his fiduciary duties.
