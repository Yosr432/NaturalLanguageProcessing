Flipboard has confirmed that it has raised $50 million. Flipboard didn t provide valuation for the round, though JP Morgan is participating, and the funding will be used to build out the product and team, the company said. According to the regulatory documents, the valuation of the most-recent round could range from $800 million to $1.32 billion. The raise comes at a time when rumors cropped up that Twitter might buy Flipboard   though, to be sure, it s not exactly clear how far those talks progressed   and had held discussions with a few other companies like Google and Yahoo. The company said its user base had jumped 75% in the past six months or so to 72 million monthly active users, with the vast majority of that coming from mobile devices. The company said it sees anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 activations every day around the world. Still, the company will face stiff competition from new entries like Apple News   and will have to grapple whether the company can continue to grow in the face of that competition.
