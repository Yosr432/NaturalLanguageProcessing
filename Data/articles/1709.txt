As Ad Tech consolidates, firms that could be acquisition targets: InMobi tops list: AOL reportedly in talks to buy mobile ad network Millennial Media for $300 million to $350 million, which would let AOL sell ads within thousands of apps and give it access to more data and better targeting tools. But industry players said there are other mobile companies up for grabs. 1. InMobi is one of the first choices to replace Millennial on a list of lucrative, independent mobile players. Google supposedly had its eye on the India-based network earlier this year, but CEO Naveen Tewari claims he wants to keep the company independent. InMobi's a bit bigger internationally than it is in the U.S., but it's acquired companies like Overlay Media a data scientist team that zeroes in on targeting to build up its ad offerings. Verve, xAd and NinthDecimal all put a different spin on working the location data that bounces off of phones for advertisers. Sam Bloom, general manager of interactive at Camelot, contended that the players risk being outpaced as digital powerhouses Facebook, Google and Yahoo build their own geo-targeting technology. "My sense is some of these [smaller] guys will just crumble," Bloom said. "While [location has] been unique for a period of time, I don't think that's the case any longer. Over time, the smaller guys will get beat because the bigger guys have bigger sales forces."
