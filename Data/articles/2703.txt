Snapchat is getting into p2p payments; linking audience identity information to (currently anonymous) Snapchat might be the rationale: Snapchat doesn t ask for your real name, but its on the debit card you use for its new peer-to-peer payments feature Snapcash. That could prove very lucrative for the ephemeral messaging service. To use the feature for sending friends money that launched today, users connect their debit card to their Snapchat accounts through a partnership with Square Cash. The real names, addresses, and account information associated with those debit cards could potentially be cross-referenced with databases of personal information to give Snapchat a much better idea of who users are and what ads they might want to see.
