Distress Sale #2: One Kings Lane, Once Valued at $900 Million, Is Likely to Sell for a Fraction of That: One Kings Lane, the online seller of furniture and home decor that has struggled for the better part of the last two years, has been running a process to sell the company for several months, four sources told Re/code. The company had aimed to seal a deal by the end of 2015, one of these people said, calling it a  fire sale.  After originally seeking a higher price, One Kings Lane notified potential buyers in the last few months that it was willing to sell for less than the $230 million it had raised in venture capital, multiple sources said. It s not clear if a deal is done or who the potential buyer would be, but sources say a deal is unlikely to fetch more than $150 million. That would mean at least some investors will lose money and any employee stock would likely become worthless. Several of One Kings Lane s investors have a liquidation preference, according to venture data startup PitchBook, meaning they will get paid out before holders of common stock, such as employees. The company most recently cut a quarter of its staff in December, including five members of its senior management team. Sources said the layoffs were likely a condition to get a deal done.
