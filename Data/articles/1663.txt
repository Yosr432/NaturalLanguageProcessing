Tata Communications plans to sell data centre business: Tata Communications plans to sell a 74% stake in its subsidiary Tata Communications Data Centre Pvt Ltd, reports indicate. Talks with some private equity and strategic investors have begun, and the deal size would likely be around $300 million and help Tata Communications reduce debt on its books. According to Tata Communications  2014 annual report, the data centre subsidiary is profitable, and returned a net profit of Rs. 23 crore for 2013-14 on a revenue of Rs. 375 crore. The company is yet to announce its numbers for 2014-15.  In the long run, unless the company is able to raise equity funding, its ability to raise additional debt funding may be restricted. This, in turn, could adversely affect the capital expenditure programme in the long run,  the annual report said. Tata Communications Data Centre has facilities in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune and some tier-II, and tier-III towns. The company also provides data centre services in the US, the UK and Singapore. It owns over 1 million sq. ft of data centre and co-location space across 44 global locations and also has eight partner sites in Australia, Malaysia, Germany and the Netherlands, according to the company s website. In 2013-14, the Tata Communications had a 28% market share of the Indian data market and a 25% market share of the Indian data centre market, according to the company s annual report. Several global and Indian firms are in the process of setting up data centres in India.
