Cisco Earnings: Quarterly Revenue $12.1B, +5% Y/Y; Net Income $2.4B; Shares Flat; Analysts Hail Cisco's Resilience: Cisco Systems delivered gains in quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday that slightly surpassed Wall Street s expectations. The company reported a 12 percent increase in net profit, to $2.4 billion. Its operating earnings of 54 cents a share were just above analysts  consensus estimate of 53 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.1 billion, essentially in line with the average analyst forecast of $12.07 billion. Parts of the business were weak: Sales to telecommunications and cable companies were off by 7 percent and sales in emerging markets slipped, particularly in Russia and China. Cisco shares were down slightly in after-hours trading. Over the last year, Cisco shares have climbed 28 percent. Over the years, Cisco rivals have surfaced from Silicon Valley to China. But Cisco has managed to stay on top.  Its scale and breadth are extremely hard to replicate,  said Amitabh Passi, an analyst at UBS. That heft amounts to what Pierre Ferragu, an analyst for the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, called  a powerful platform advantage  in a report last week.
