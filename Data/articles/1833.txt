Google Highlights Cloud Capabilities as GCP Beats AWS, Microsoft to Win HTC as Customer: At an event Tuesday for Google Cloud Platform   Google s name for the computing, storage and networking it sells to business   Google will name the Taiwanese phone maker HTC as a customer. HTC has used Google to build a new kind of computing architecture that enables smartphone apps to update data fast and reliably to many devices at once, and look efficient even when the phones get poor reception. HTC also looked at the cloud offerings of AWS and Microsoft Azure, along with IBM and Alibaba. Google was the dark horse, because it does not operate in China, and HTC wanted to be everywhere in the world. Google s technical dedication won the day.  The other salesmen just wanted to take orders,  Google is talking more openly about companies that use its cloud business, and revealing more about its computing resources, perhaps the largest on the planet. These include disclosures about Google s ultrafast fiber network, its big data resources, and the computers and software it has built for itself. The disclosures follow earlier moves by Google Cloud Platform, as the search company s cloud computing business is called, to show off its data analysis capabilities. The aim is to position Google as a company capable of handling the biggest and toughest computational exercises, lightning fast. Each cloud player is now reflecting the nature of its core business. Amazon, a retailer, is offering computing at scale and ease of use in data analysis. Microsoft, with decades of business ties, stresses its interoperability with current systems and data tools. And IBM has lots of high-level data analysts. Google Cloud Platform has built out specialties in areas like manufacturing, genomics and media to handle industry-specific needs on a global basis.
