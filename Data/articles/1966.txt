Alibaba-backed Visualead rolls out new dotless QR codes that aim to reduce counterfeiting. In January, Alibaba disclosed its investment in Visualead, an Israeli startup that helps brands make colorful, visually appealing QR codes. While the company s product was cute, its value to Alibaba is growing clearer now that it has revealed a new QR code alternative that aims to prevent counterfeit sales. Alibaba is using Visualead s technology to power Blue Star, a new tool that prints out individual, scannable codes for individual packages. When scanned using the mobile app for Taobao, an image appears confirming (or denying) the product s authenticity. Brands can choose from a set number of templates to customize these landing images and throw in links to promotions or e-commerce pages  perhaps even ones that are on an Alibaba property. Visualead co-founder and CEO Nevo Alva tells Tech in Asia that Alibaba only opens Blue Star to genuine brands. That means Nike can sign up, but FakeNikes.com will get turned away. Alva also adds that Alibaba is providing Blue Star free-of-charge for the time being, irrespective of where the goods will be sold. That means that Nike can pin the codes to packages that will go to an Alibaba competitor.
