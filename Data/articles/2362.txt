Baidu Q4 earnings: revenue $2.26B, +47.5%; shares down 9% on earnings miss; Baidu, owner of China's dominant search engine, reported a lower-than-expected 47.5 percent rise in quarterly revenue as more users switched from PCs to mobile devices, which have less space for more lucrative forms of advertising. Shares of the U.S.-listed company fell 7.8 percent to $198 in extended trading on Wednesday. Baidu, sometimes referred to as China's Google, reported revenue of 14.05 billion yuan, or $2.26 billion, for the fourth quarter, falling short of the average analyst estimate of 14.12 billion yuan, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mobile revenue represented 42 percent of total revenue, up from 36 percent in the third quarter, Baidu said. "In December, for the first time search revenue from mobile surpassed PC," Chief Executive Robin Li said in a statement. Baidu forecast revenue of 12.65 billion-13.07 billion yuan ($2.04 billion-$2.12 billion) for the current quarter. Analysts on average expected revenue of 13.62 billion yuan. The forecast reflects the combined impact of the late timing of Chinese New Year and increased contribution from mobile as a percentage of overall revenue, the company said. Baidu is facing increased competition on smartphones as companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) invest in apps and content to keep users engaged. Net income attributable to Baidu jumped 16 percent to 3.23 billion yuan, or $520.4 million, for the fourth quarter.
