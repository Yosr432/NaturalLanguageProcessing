Worryingly the gap between Amazon s growth rate and that of the North American e-commerce industry narrowed to a sliver last year. The Seattle-based company s growth is decelerating even as Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos invests in speedier delivery and gadgets. In 2014, Amazon s sales in North America -- its biggest region by revenue -- rose 23 percent, compared with 16 percent for the e-commerce market in the U.S. and Canada, according to researcher EMarketer Inc. The seven percentage point difference is the smallest since at least 2009, the earliest that EMarketer started keeping track of such data. In 2011, Amazon s North American sales grew at 41 percent, about 2.5 times the 17 percent pace of the e-commerce market. The diminishing gap highlights just how much Amazon s once breakneck pace of growth has slowed. The online retailer is confronting challenges, including a large size that makes moving the needle on sales more difficult, as well as more competitors stepping up their online efforts.
