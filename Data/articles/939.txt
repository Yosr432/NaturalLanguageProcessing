SoftBank Rises the Most in Seven Years on Record Share Buyback: SoftBank climbed the most in more than seven years after the company said it will spend a record 500 billion yen ($4.4 billion) buying back stock. The stock rose as much as 15 percent to 5,040 yen as of 9:26 a.m. in Tokyo on Tuesday. SoftBank will purchase as many as 167 million shares, or 14.2 percent of its stock, using cash holdings and the proceeds of asset sales, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement Monday. The Japanese wireless carrier saw its shares drop to their lowest since buying Sprint Corp. in 2013 as Chairman Masayoshi Son struggled to persuade investors he can turn around the U.S. company. The shares were down 28 percent this year before the buyback announcement, putting SoftBank s market value well below that of its own investments in companies including Sprint and Alibaba.  This is a good buyback, considering how low their valuation has fallen,  said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC.  Nothing so bad happened with Sprint and Alibaba to justify the drop in SoftBank shares.
