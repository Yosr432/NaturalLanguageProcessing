Walmart was the only bidder in $3 billion Jet.com acquisition: When news first broke of Walmart s interest in acquiring Jet.com, the $3 billion price tag was a surprise to many. Why would Walmart pay such a premium for a startup that was unprofitable and just a year old  One hypothesis was that Walmart may have been competing against other bidders for Jet   possibly Alibaba or even Google. Turns out that was not the case, Jet CEO Marc Lore told Recode in an interview Monday afternoon.  This was about trust between Doug and I,  Lore said in reference to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, noting that the conversations between the two sides began in the spring.  It never occurred to me to go out and get another offer, quite honestly,  he added.  As part of the deal, Lore will take over as head of Walmart.com in addition to Jet, as Recode first reportedSunday evening. Neil Ashe, Walmart s CEO of global e-commerce, will depart at the end of Walmart s fiscal year. In a conference call with reporters, McMillon outlined why Walmart found Jet so valuable. It was a combination of the speed of the shopping site s growth (a $1 billion annualized sales volume run rate within eight months of launch); the expertise of the exec team led by Lore that is joining Walmart in the deal; and the proprietary pricing and back-end technology that is expected to eventually be used in some capacity on Walmart.com.
