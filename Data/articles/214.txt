Dropbox claims $1B revenue run rate: Today at an event in San Francisco in which it announced updates to its Paper app and its Smart Sync feature, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston talked up the company s revenue growth and self-serve business model. Houston claimed that Dropbox was on pace for a $1 billion revenue run rate and that the company was free-cash flow positive, which could bolster the company s plans for a rumored late-2017 IPO. To be sure, a $1 billion run rate would be impressive. Box reported in its last quarter that it generated $102.8 million in revenue. Box, from the get-go, gunned for enterprises and for the large part has built a brand around the company   and Aaron Levie   as one that specializes in enterprise software. That s given it the capability of selling itself to larger companies over a company that has largely held a strong consumer brand like Dropbox. But just having a $1 billion run rate doesn t mean that Dropbox s work is done. While it works to rapidly build a strong enterprise product, it has companies like Salesforce acquiring Quip for $750 million and placing it in a position to beat out its note-taking app Paper.
