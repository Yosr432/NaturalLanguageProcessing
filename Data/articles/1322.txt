Facebook Is Building Its Own YouTube Inside Facebook: Facebook has started serving up billions and billions of videos to its users by placing the clips in their feeds, between pictures of your friends  kids and stories about people who don t have kids. But what if you wanted to watch a video on Facebook, without looking at kids or reading about them  Like you can on YouTube  Now Facebook is going to let you do that, too: The social network says it is testing a  dedicated place on Facebook for people to go when they exclusively want to watch video,  which will help  people discover, watch and share videos on Facebook that are relevant to them.  Just like you can do on YouTube, the world s biggest video site. The parallels between the two platforms aren t a coincidence, and Facebook s announcement is one that video industry insiders have expected for at least a year, starting when Facebook began its video push in earnest: If Facebook was going to really take on YouTube for video viewers  time   and, eventually, advertisers  dollars   then it would have to offer an experience like YouTube, where you could go look for things you want, instead of waiting for Facebook to show you something you didn t know you wanted.
