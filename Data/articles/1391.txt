YouTube Is Prepping Its Subscription Launch: Two Services, One Price: YouTube, which spent the first 10 years of its life as a free service, is getting ready to start selling tickets. Google s video site appears to be finalizing launch plans for its long-in-the-making subscription service, and industry sources say they ve been told to expect a launch near the end of October. A blast email from YouTube to content owners, telling them they have to agree to new terms by Oct. 22 or their  videos will no longer be available for public display or monetization in the United States,  helps support that timeline. But YouTube, which floated the idea of a new subscription service nearly a year ago, has never publicly committed to a timeline. Last spring, YouTube executives were telling content owners they were aiming for a mid-summer launch. It s possible the launch could keep slipping, even beyond 2015. Note that we re referring to a single service, not multiple ones. Sources say that s because YouTube intends to bundle two different services into one offering: An update of its music service, which it launched in beta as YouTube Music Key last fall, and another service, yet to launch, that will give users the ability to watch anything on YouTube without seeing ads. Video industry sources say Google has told them it intends to charge $10 a month for the combined offering. It s hard to imagine how YouTube will make money at that pricing, since its music service was supposed to cost $10 on its own, with the music labels and other copyright owners pocketing the majority of that.
