SAP Takes SuccessFactors and Concur to the Cloud: The new integration is being offered as a sort of  multi-tenant  business, akin to the public clouds of Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, only for a set of fewer, but more high-level, functions. What that means is that it will be possible for customers of SAP, along with independent software developers, to make software applications that can take data from different elements of their business and build new kinds of information services. Both Ariba and SuccessFactors were independent online software companies that SAP purchased to hasten its transition from selling packaged software to a rental model. The features and data from another SAP acquisition, Concur, which does travel procurement and management, will also be integrated into S4 in the near future.  Cloud-based revenue in the first quarter of the year was about $564 million, up 129 percent from a year ago. That was still a relative sliver of the $5 billion in total revenue the company scored, but total revenue was up 22 percent.
