...and Google Search too: It isn't just Gmail. The government of China, which this weekend launched a tweak to its Great Firewall filtering regime that blocked much of mainland China's access to Google's e-mail service, has on Monday cut off access nationwide to Google Search as well, reports one Internet intelligence expert. And, says Earl Zmijewski, vice president of data analytics at the New Hampshire firm Dyn, the changes aren't the result of some accidental misconfiguration by a ham-handed government engineer in some backwater office somewhere. "This was deliberate," Zmijewski says. "It was pushed out to the whole country at once. Google and the Chinese government have long been at odds, with Google choosing to stop basing operations in mainland China in 2009 in response to Beijing's efforts at censorship. Google has chosen instead to offer services to mainland Chinese using servers located in Hong Kong. (In normal practice, Google attempts to route users to the servers located the closest to them, or otherwise most quickly accessible; a user in New Hampshire, for example, might be routed to New York.) But this week's actions suggest a raising of the Great Firewall specifically to cut that passageway between the Chinese people and Google's services in Hong Kong. Beijing is using the bluntest instrument it has available to it to keep Google out, and isn't worried much about who knows it. Simple blocking of Internet protocol, or IP, addresses is the "easiest and crudest" method that China has for maintaining the effectiveness of its Great Firewall. Beijing also uses so-called "DNS poisoning," or the takeover of the address tables that govern the Internet so that a user who types, say, Twitter.com into her browser window is misdirected to another Web site. And then there's deep packet inspection, such as blocking online references to terms like "Falun Gong" or "Dalai Lama." But those methods can be technologically tricky and expensive.
