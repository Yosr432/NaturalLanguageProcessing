Microsoft s Cloud Business, Seen as a Salvation, Falls Short of Investors  Hopes: Cloud computing is seen by many investors as Microsoft s salvation, the growing business that has convinced many there s a bright future for the company beyond the troubled PC market. But Microsoft s cloud business didn t grow quite fast enough during its last quarter to keep investors happy. The company missed Wall Street estimates, though Microsoft executives said it would have beaten them without the impact of unexpectedly high taxes. For its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31, Microsoft reported net income of $3.76 billion, or 47 cents a share, down from $4.99 billion, or 61 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell to $20.53 billion, from $21.73 billion. Microsoft s traditional profit engines, like Windows, have weakened considerably as sales in the PC market have remained in a multiyear slump. Last week, the research firm Gartner reported that worldwide PC shipments in the first quarter fell 9.6 percent from a year ago. Yet Microsoft has convinced many investors that it has found a way to adapt to technology changes, in part by vigorously embracing cloud computing. Shares of Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., are still trading near their price in 1999, their high, even with a 5 percent drop in value Thursday evening. The optimism stems from its success in transitioning legacy software businesses like Office to a cloud business model in which customers subscribe to the applications. There are now 22.2 million subscribers to Office 365, the subscription version of its Office business, up from 12.4 million a year ago.
