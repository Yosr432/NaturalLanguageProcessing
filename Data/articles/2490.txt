Study Finds: Using Facebook and Twitter a lot can actually decrease stress   especially among women: It's become almost common knowledge now that being constantly connected makes us unhappy, particularly when it comes to being inundated with incessant social media posts. There's a reason that "unplugging" was a popular New Year's resolution for 2015. But before you decide that limiting your Facebook posts or Twitter messages is the answer to all your problems, we have some news for you: Active social media use can actually lower stress levels -- at least for women. That's the takeaway finding from a study published Thursday by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. Three things make this study stand out, said Keith N. Hampton, a Rutgers University communications professor and the paper's lead author: Social media provide what Hampton calls "supportive exchange." In other words, people feel less stressed because they can stay in contact with friends and family, and feel that community support. (The world "social" is a clue.Women tend to be, in Hampton's words, the people tasked with "maintaining household family relationships." So when it comes to social media, the technology may actually be helping them fulfill those tasks more efficiently and save them time. Women are more likely to be active sharers than men. And posting a quick photo on Instagram or update on Facebook is a low-cost, easy way to do that. "Whether you share positive or negative events, sharing results in lowered levels of stress," Hampton said. "While not everyone wants to see them all the time, [posting] may be important for women in reducing stress."
