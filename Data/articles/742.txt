Some Online Bargains May Only Look Like One: Amazon has some unbelievable bargains on its virtual shelves. A cat litter pan with a list price of $2,159 can be yours for a mere $28. A bag of doggy treats, normally $822, is only $8. A windshield wiper blade, which the unwary pay $1,504 for, has been knocked down 99 percent. You say you don t believe that a plastic cat pan could ever have been sold to anyone for a couple of thousand bucks  Or that a six-ounce bag of Zuke s Lil  Links pork and apple sausage bits ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaurant  It s all part of the bizarre world of Internet  discounts,  which let retailers and brands assert that you are getting a stupendous deal because someone somewhere else   exactly where is never explained   is being charged much more. Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm, compared the list prices of dozens of pet items on Amazon and the specialist pet site Chewy.com. In only a handful of cases did the retailers even agree on what the list price was. So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy. Yet the retail price at both sites was the same: $49.49.  A perceived deeper discount creates a higher conversion event   in other words, more buyers,  said Boomerang s chief executive, Guru Hariharan, who previously worked at Amazon. Another consultant, Ripen eCommerce, analyzed 746,000 product searches on Amazon. Ripen s goal was to help third-party clients who sell on the giant retailer jockey for a better position   say, on the first page of results rather than further back. A little over 44 percent of the products   some sold directly by Amazon, others by third parties   were billed as discounted, Ripen said.  It s less than I expected, actually,  said Dave Rekuc, Ripen s director of marketing.  Considering you can basically name your own list price.
