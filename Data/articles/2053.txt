Apple earnings: revenue $58B (+27% Y/Y), net income $13.6B (+33%). Another monster quarter sends shares modestly up (1.3%):  In total, revenue climbed 27 percent to $58 billion, up from $45.6 billion last year, the company said in its earnings report. Profit was $13.6 billion, up from $10.2 billion a year ago.  Mr. Dawson said. Over all, Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, beating analysts  estimates of roughly 60 million phones. That also far exceeded the 43.7 million iPhones that Apple sold in the period a year ago. Analysts had anticipated that iPhone sales would increase sharply, largely because of the company s growing presence in greater China. Apple also said it was seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhones from Android smartphones. Sales of Apple s iPad declined for the fifth quarter in a row, however. The company sold 12.6 million iPads, compared with 16.4 million tablets a year ago. Over the last year, Apple s tablet sales have steadily shrunk, partly because people do not upgrade those devices as frequently as they do smartphones. In addition, as smartphone screen sizes increase, some consumers question whether they need both a tablet and a phone. Apple also sold 4.6 million Mac computers in the quarter, up from 4.1 million a year ago. Apple on Monday also said it increased its capital return program by 50 percent, to $200 billion in cash by the end of March 2017. Apple is increasing its share repurchases to $140 billion from $90 billion, and is also raising its dividend to shareholders. The company s cash and securities pile stood at $193.5 billion as of the end of the quarter.
