PayPal outlook muted on mobile competition, currency trends: PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) offered a subdued outlook on Thursday, as it faced unpredictable currency fluctuations and an increasingly competitive digital payments market. The payments processor predicted its first-quarter revenue would be roughly in line with analyst expectations, with flat to slightly better operating margins for the full year. PayPal gave the guidance in reporting a 17 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue that mirrored Wall Street expectations. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said fourth-quarter results were hurt by currency movements, and he expected those pressures to continue throughout the year. Paypal stock fell 2.4 percent in after hours trading to $40.49.Schulman said growth in mobile payments and new customer accounts helped boost fourth-quarter revenue to $3 billion, up 17 percent compared with a year earlier, the same as what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected. Net income rose to $390 million, or 32 cents per share, from $367 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 42 cents per share.
