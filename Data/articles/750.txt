Apple Watch verdict a year later: Half of those surveyed think it s a dud: More than half of those surveyed by the advertising technology company Fluent said they considered the Apple Watch a flop. That sentiment   expressed by the majority of the 2,578 adults in the U.S. who responded last week to an online survey   reflects how the device is perceived by the tech press and industry insiders, many of whom have been pessimistic about the Apple Watch from the start. Asked whether they considered the Watch a successful product for Apple, 53 percent responded  no.  But Fluent s survey also offers a more nuanced picture of Apple s first wearable device,which launched on April 24, 2015. A significant majority of Apple Watch owners   77 percent   consider the smartwatch a success and about two-thirds said they plan to upgrade when the next version comes out. Those owners surveyed said they take advantage of a range of the smartwatch s features, including monitoring their activity and receiving notifications (79 percent), listening to music (75 percent) and checking email or chat (66 percent). This survey supports the more comprehensive findings of Wristly s  Pulse on Wristware,  released earlier this year. The research group, which surveys some 2,500 smartwatch and fitness band owners every week, says that despite some views of the Apple Watch as a  mediocre novelty,  it enjoys  astoundingly high customer satisfaction ratings.
