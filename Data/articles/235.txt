Twitter is phasing out the  Buy  button, will continue to offer donations: There have been rumors for a while about Twitter preparing to retire its commerce operation. Now it looks like the company has finally started to wind down its partnerships in confirmation of that fact. Customers of e-commerce platform Shopify are receiving notices informing them that the Twitter sales channel is getting shut down  as a result of the Twitter team pivoting way from their ecommerce focus.   From what we understand, Twitter is now gradually winding down the  Buy  button, and with it the partnerships that it forged to bring in retailers and other businesses to use them. At the same time, Twitter will continue to offer a  Donate  button to give to charitable causes and other nonprofits, which Twitter will offer directly. Other links to Buy information, such as this information page on Twitter s Business site, will also slowly now start to disappear, as the products are no longer being offered. None of this should come as a surprise, apart from the fact that it s taken so long. The moves to wind down the Buy button come about eight months after a report noted that Twitter was ceasing product development of its Buy button and was disbanding its commerce team. Nathan Hubbard, the executive who was leading that team, left the company a day later. A few months after that, Twitter announced a new focus on its website conversions product, which is where it is now channeling interest in action-based marketing on the platform.
