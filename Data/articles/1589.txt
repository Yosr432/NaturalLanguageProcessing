HTC Trading Near Cash Leaves a Smartphone Brand - Once the leader in the US - With No Value: A 56 percent plunge in HTC s stock this year has brought its market value near to cash on hand. That means investors are effectively saying th smartphone maker s brand, factories and buildings are almost worthless. At NT$52.2 billion ($1.6 billion), HTC s market price is barely above the NT$47.2 billion cash it had at the end of June. A further 9.5 percent drop in its stock from the NT$63 close on Friday would bring the two figures into alignment, signaling investors put no value on the rest of the company. HTC s fall from a market capitalization of more than NT$900 billion in 2011 charts the perils of a product and marketing strategy that s failed in the face of stiffer competition from Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies. Once the best-selling brand in the U.S., the failure of its One, Butterfly and Desire smartphones to drive sales has pushed HTC outside a global top-10 now dominated by Chinese brands. Its forecast for third-quarter sales of as much as 48 percent below analyst estimates follows a 35 percent cut to projected revenue in the preceding period and indicates that the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company has little chance of regaining market share in the short-term.  HTC s cash is the only asset of value to shareholders,  said Calvin Huang, who has a NT$46.50 price target on the stock at Sinopac Financial Holdings Co. in Taipei.  Most of the other assets shouldn t be considered in their valuation because there s more write-offs to come and the brand has no value.
