Facebook Just Made 2 Big Changes to Appease Advertisers on Viewability - Offers premium option and third-party verification: Facebook today introduced a premium buying choice that should quell some of that unease, offering marketers the option to pay for ads only when the entire unit appears on a viewer's screen.  Until this change, advertisers were charged as soon as any piece of an ad appeared on a Facebook user's screen. Now they will have the option to require full visibility before being charged at a higher per-view rate (which hasn't yet been announced). The development is part of a two-tiered announcement today by the Menlo Park, Calif.-based tech giant, which also revealed that it has tapped digital-measurement company Moat to check how often advertisers' promos are seen on Facebook. While Moat is among several viewability-focused vendors that are accredited by the Media Ratings Council, inking this deal which likely involves considerable sums of money in the near future with Facebook appears to be the latest sign that Moat is leading its niche.  What's more, Facebook is reversing its stance against using an independent verifier for ad viewability. The move appears to be largely in response to huge companies like Unilever, Kellogg's and WPP banging the drum for better measurement tools in not only recent years but recent hours. Just yesterday, WPP chief Martin Sorrell called out Facebook's viewability standards while speaking at Dmexco in Cologne, Germany.
