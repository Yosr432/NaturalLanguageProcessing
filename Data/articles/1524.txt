Visa says its users more likely to complete online purchases than those using PayPal: Visa said on Monday online shoppers using its payment service are 17 percentage points more likely to complete their purchases than those using PayPal. Visa Checkout, which allows shoppers to store their payment information without having to re-enter it every time they make a purchase online, said 66 percent of its enrolled customers completed their transactions after putting items in their shopping cart compared to 49 percent of PayPal's Express Checkout customers. The data was collated for Visa by retail analytics firm ComScore. PayPal's online payment service offers a similar convenience by allowing customers to log into their accounts on a merchant's website. Paypal has not seen this report yet, said Anuj Nayar, senior director of platform, merchant and next gen commerce engagement. Nayar said in addition to PayPal Express Checkout the company has launched a new online payment service called PayPal One Touch, which makes using PayPal faster on any device with a single touch. "Initial reports indicate that One Touch radically improves checkout conversion for merchants and time to checkout for consumers beyond anything else available in the market today," he said. Retailers and payment industry experts have often blamed the high rates of unfinished online transactions, after shoppers add items to their shopping carts, on the tiring process of re-entering payment information every time one makes a purchase. "What has become more and more pronounced is as the size of the screen gets smaller, whether it's a tablet, mobile or a watch, the less likely it becomes a consumer will finish his purchase," Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of Visa's digital solutions, told Reuters.
