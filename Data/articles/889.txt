SurveyMonkey to Lay Off 100 and Retool Business Product: Cloud-based polling service SurveyMonkey informed employees today that it is letting go of about 100 people in a plan to retool its product aimed at businesses, which is not living up to expectations. The layoffs were to be disclosed at an internal meeting this afternoon. The cuts amount to about 13 percent of SurveyMonkey s workforce of about 750. The cuts were made primarily among the sales team devoted to SurveyMonkey for Business.  The move comes six weeks into the tenure of SurveyMonkey s new CEO Zander Lurie, the former GoPro exec who joined in January. In an interview, Lurie told Re/code that SurveyMonkey, which is privately held, is on track to post $200 million in 2016 with an Ebitda profit margin of north of 30 percent.
