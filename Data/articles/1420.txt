Adobe revenue, profit forecast miss estimates, shares slip. Adobe Systems Inc's lower-than-expected revenue and profit forecast for the current quarter overshadowed a strong rise in net subscriptions for its Creative Cloud software suite, sending its shares down 3.5 percent in extended trading. Revenue rose 21 percent to $1.22 billion. Net income rose to $174.5 million, or 34 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $44.7 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Up to Thursday's close of $80.31, Adobe's shares had risen about 11 percent this year. The company also said on Thursday that David Wadhwani, head of its digital media, was leaving to pursue a CEO opportunity. Adobe has been switching to web-based subscriptions from traditional licensed software to help attract more predictable recurring revenue. Recurring revenue had reached 73 percent of total revenue, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in a statement. The company said it added 684,000 Creative Cloud net subscriptions in the quarter ended Aug. 28, compared with the 640,000 net additions that analysts had expected, according to research firm FactSet Street Account.
