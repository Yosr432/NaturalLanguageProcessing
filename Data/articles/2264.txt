Amazon opens store on Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall: Amazon.com Inc has opened an online store on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's fast-growing online marketplace, Tmall.com as it seeks to expand in China, an Alibaba spokesman said. Alibaba's Tmall offers virtual storefronts and payment portals to merchants. Several western retailers, including Zara owner Inditex, Britain's Burberry and ASOS, have joined TMall this year as they look to boost their presence in China. Imported food, shoes, toys and kitchenware are listed on Amazon's store, one of the many on Tmall that sell brand-name goods to Chinese shoppers, Bloomberg, which first reported the news, said on Thursday. Amazon also operates its own e-commerce site in China. U.S. retailer Costco Wholesale Corp last year opened an online store in China using Tmall, entering the country's booming e-commerce market to combat slowing sales at home. Amazon s China website has long struggled in the country, trailing behind Alibaba s two marketplaces (Taobao and Tmall) as well as other homegrown rivals like JD and Suning. Amazon was China s eighth biggest estore at the end of 2014, with just 1.3 percent market share of transaction value, according to data from iResearch. Tmall dominates the market with 57.6 percent market share. It s an awkward but inevitable situation for Amazon. It s as if Amazon opened up a huge shop on the wrong side of town and then had to suffer the indignity of opening up a branch in Alibaba s crowded shopping mall where there s much greater foot traffic. This move means Amazon is effectively an Alibaba customer and has to pay a commission for each sale that occurs in the Tmall outlet. A number of major brands and retailers use Tmall for their flagship stores, even though many have their own standalone ecommerce sites in China. Other online retailing companies have opened up stores on Tmall before, such as Walmart s Yihaodian.
