Opera offers new feature for free access to mobile Web apps: Norway's Opera, whose browser software has helped mobile operators sign up millions of users for free or low-cost Internet access, said on Tuesday it was introducing features that let operators offer subscribers free access to selected apps. Opera Max was first introduced last year for Android smartphone users to download free-of-charge. Opera browser users could gain access to an hour or a day of free time on Facebook or music on Spotify using the software. What's different with the new feature, called Opera Max with App Pass, is that it is no longer confined solely to Opera browser users. Instead, App Pass works with any browser or mobile app that an Android phone user may choose to use.
