Facebook working on competitor to Twitter's MoPub: Facebook Inc. is working on a competitor to Twitter Inc. s mobile-advertising distributor MoPub, according to people with knowledge of the matter, a bid to win more business in a growing market. The product is among several advertising moves that may be announced at the company s F8 developer conference this month, though Facebook hasn t yet decided whether it will release it then, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Facebook has been building out the infrastructure that would support such a product. At its developer conference last year, Facebook released its Audience Network, giving advertisers a way to run their Facebook ads on third-party mobile applications. Its Atlas product also tracks people anonymously to give advertisers feedback on their ads, telling marketers if a person has seen the spots and on what device. MoPub, which Twitter acquired in 2013, gives advertisers a single place to serve their promotions to mobile apps and get feedback on their performance. Advertisers can bid in real time on prime locations for their ads on more than 1 billion devices.
