The military s stealth motorcycles are as quiet as an electric toothbrush: The military is funding stealth motorcycles, which would allow riders to quickly sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. The motorcycles operate at 55 decibels   about the level of an electric toothbrush or typical conversation   yet still can reach 80 mph in speed. The extreme quiet is due to the use of electric motors. The motorcycles also feature two-wheel drive to improve traction on gravel, sand or any challenging terrain. The narrow dimensions of the motorcycles allow them to be driven in forests or other places some military vehicles can t go.The electric motors have limited range   the SilentHawk lasts two hours and the other bike, NightMare, has 60 miles of power. So the motorcycles are modified with hybrid engines that can burn almost any type of fuel, such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene or diesel. The thinking is these hybrid engines, which are about as loud as a vacuum cleaner, can be used on the part of a mission where being quiet isn t essential. Using the back-up engine increases the SilentHawk s range to 170 miles.
