CommonFloor raises funding from Google Capital; prospect of lower interest rates propeling India Real Estate Tech: CommonFloor.com, has raised an undisclosed amount in funding from Google Capital, the corporate venture capital arm of tech giant Google Inc. The fresh funding comes just three months after the firm grabbed $30 million (Rs 181 crore) in Series E round of funding from existing investor Tiger Global Management. This is Google Capital s second investment in India following its investment in SaaS-based customer support solutions startup Freshdesk Inc in mid-2014 and the third ever in Asia. So far, since its launch in the summer of 2013, Google Capital has made just ten bets, seven of them in the US. The only ones outside America are Chinese optical components maker Innolight, India s cloud-based customer support software maker Freshdesk, which is headquartered in San Francisco, and now CommonFloor. A lowering of home loan rates, a relaxation of FDI (foreign direct investment) in construction, and an improvement in business sentiment after a new government took over in India last year have given the real estate sector a boost.
