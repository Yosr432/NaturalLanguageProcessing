Alibaba Declines as Chinese ADRs Retreat on Economic Slowdown; Down 35% from Post-IPO High: Alibaba, China s biggest online retailer, slid for an eighth day as fresh data highlighting China s weakening economy stoked concern that the company s sales growth is slowing. The American depositary receipts retreated 0.4 percent to $77.99 in New York on Monday, capping the longest slump since the company s September debut. The drop pushed Alibaba s decline from its high in November to 35 percent. Alibaba sold ADRs for $68 apiece in a record $25 billion initial public offering on Sept. 18. They had climbed as much as 75 percent in the following two months to a record high of $119.15 in November. The company will probably report a 34 percent increase in sales for the June quarter, down from 46 percent in the same period last year, according to the average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. LightInTheBox, a web-based retailer of China-made goods to overseas markets, tumbled 9.3 percent to $3.63, the lowest since its U.S. listing in June 2013. Jumei International, which sells beauty products online, sank 6.7 percent to $17.46, dropping the most in four weeks.
