How Netflix Is Deepening Our Cultural Echo Chambers: For a brief while, from the 1950s to the late 1980s, broadcast television served cultural, social and political roles far greater than the banality of its content would suggest. Because it featured little choice, TV offered something else: the raw material for a shared culture. Television was the thing just about everyone else was watching at the same time as you. In its enforced similitude, it became a kind of social glue, stitching together a new national identity across a vast, growing and otherwise diverse nation.  What we gained was a shared identity and shared experience,  Mr. Strate said.  The famous example was Kennedy s funeral, where the nation mourned together in a way that had never happened before. But it was also our experience watching  I Love Lucy  and  All in the Family  that created a shared set of references that everyone knew.  As the broadcast era changed into one of cable and then streaming, TV was transformed from a wasteland into a bubbling sea of creativity. But it has become a sea in which everyone swims in smaller schools.
