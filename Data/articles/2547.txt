"Unbundling" is causing US eCommerce order values to fall, as consumers spread purchases across multiple transactions: While sales were up overall this year, order value was down 8 percent from 2013, with the average order costing $119.33. Experts say these offers can prompt shoppers to "unbundle" their orders, meaning that shoppers may spread out their purchases over several transactions instead of scooping up slippers for Mom and "Frozen" pajamas for the kids in one order. According to data released Monday by IBM, sales on mobile devices rose by 27 percent in November and December over the same period last year. And yet sales made through smartphones and tablets still only accounted for about 23 percent of online sales overall, with a whopping 77 percent of sales coming from desktops and laptops. IBM also studied how social sites Facebook and Pinterest drive retail sales. The analysis found that shoppers who came to retailer's Web site through a Facebook post spent an average of $101.38 per order, while those who came from Pinterest spent $105.75.  Henderson said a key difference might be that Facebook included a mix of sponsored ads and posts from friends, while Pinterest did not contain ads, a sign that perhaps the more curated, trusted content from friends was more effective at driving sales.  (Pinterest began selling ads on Jan. 1, so that could sour some users' experience with the site in the future.) IBM found that total online sales were up a healthy 13.8 percent this holiday season compared to 2013, an uptick that was about in line with the 15 percent growth IBM had predicted.  This year's increase was significantly larger than the 8.5 percent online sales increase recorded by IBM last year.
