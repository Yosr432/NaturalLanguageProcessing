Flipkart reports some marketplace stats:  Flipkart today said it aims to help over 10,000 sellers generate business worth Rs 10 lakh through its platform this year.  In 2014, Flipkart helped over 2,000 sellers become millionaires through Flipkart sales. December 2014 alone saw over 500 sellers doing an average business of Rs 10 lakh each, while 50 sellers did an average of Rs 1 crore each,  Flipkart said in a statement. With a year on year growth of close to 30 per cent, apparels and consumer electronics categories have the most number of sellers who have crossed the millionaire mark followed by sellers of home decor, jewellery, handicrafts and large appliances. Nearly 60 per cent of millionaire sellers came from metros (Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore) and the rest from the non-metros, it said.  2015 projections estimate that the numbers from the latter will double,  the statement added.
