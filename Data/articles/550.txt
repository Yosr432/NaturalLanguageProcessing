One Unspoken Reason Behind the LinkedIn Sale:  Let me explain why.  Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn  to control our own destiny.  But there may have been another reason that he left unspoken. That would be the company s struggling stock price and its reliance   some might say overreliance   on stock-based compensation.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100. The rapid devaluation has posed more than just a problem for investors. LinkedIn s employees are paid largely in stock, and therein lies the rub: Around the company s new 26-story skyscraper that opened in downtown San Francisco in March, as well as the corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., there have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes.Mr. Weiner   who took over as LinkedIn s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder   has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years. You wouldn t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn s news releases. That s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.
