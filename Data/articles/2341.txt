Infosys acquires SaaS provider Panaya in deal valued at $200M: Consulting and IT services provider Infosys announced today that it will acquire Panaya, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software company. Worth an enterprise value of about $200 million, the deal is expected to close by the end of March.Infosys, which is based in Bengaluru, India, said that it will integrate technology from Panaya s CloudQuality suite to bring automation to some of its software. CloudQuality helps businesses test changes to SAP, Oracle EBS, and Salesforce software by identifying functions that might break and providing potential solutions including code corrections. Infosys, one of India s largest software exporters, is currently in the midst of revamping its strategy as it faces challenges including slower revenue growth than competitors like HCL Tech and TCS, and the departure of several key executives. Sikka told TechCrunch s Ron Miller last July that he would take time to understand Infosys  problems and that he believes software solutions should be about expanding the knowledge and capability of an organization. According to Crunchbase, Panaya has received $59 million in funding. Its last round, a Series E of $20 million, was disclosed in January.
