More Startups Are Getting Lower Valuations Than Joining the Billion-Dollar Club: According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, 2016 has seen a larger number of startups taking new lower valuations than those earning the billion-dollar badge.  The first quarter of 2016 has borne witness to high-profile unicorn company issues, layoffs, down rounds and mutual fund valuation markdowns,  according to the report. Only five venture capital backed companies entered the $1 billion club in the same period, less than half the number from any quarter since the first quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, CB Insights  Downround Tracker shows there were 19 "down events" or companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuation during that same time frame, including big names such as Foursquare Labs Inc., Gilt Groupe Inc., and Jawbone Inc. Those downgrades may also cause other startups to wait to raise new money if they anticipate having to take cuts themselves.
