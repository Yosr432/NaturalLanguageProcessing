JD.com launches online store to sell U.S. brands in China: JD.com Inc, the no. 2 Chinese e-commerce company, said it would start selling U.S. products to customers in China through a new store on its website, as it looks to battle competition from bigger rival Alibaba. Both companies have recently started exclusive stores that offer products from countries including Japan, France, South Korea and Australia. JD.com also said on Monday that it would be the first authorized seller of Taylor Swift merchandise in China, which will include a line of clothes designed by the singer exclusively for JD.com customers. JD.com said the "U.S. Mall" would feature American brands such as Converse, Samsonite, and major apparel labels that are part of the Global Brands Group, including Nautica Kids and Jeep apparel. JD.com's U.S.-listed shares were little changed at $35.39 on the Nasdaq. Up to Friday's close, the stock had gained about 53 percent this year.
