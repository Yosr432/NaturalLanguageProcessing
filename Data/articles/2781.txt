Walmart's smart way of gaining audience and competitor info: a mobile app that scans competitor receipts: This summer, Walmart rolled out a new mobile app called Savings Catcher that pulls in pricing information from competitors by scanning a customer s receipt. If a product is cheaper elsewhere, shoppers get the money back on a gift card. In addition to saving consumers money, the app also helps Walmart collect troves of data on shoppers.
