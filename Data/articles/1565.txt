Samsung Introduces New Phones and Mobile Payments System: The South Korean manufacturer introduced two big-screen Galaxy phones on Thursday: the Note 5, which includes a digital pen, and the S6 Edge Plus, which has a curved screen that wraps around the sides of the phone and skips the pen. The Note 5 is slightly thinner than its predecessor, the Note 4, and has some software twists. For one, you can jot down notes with the pen even when the screen is off. You can also scribble notes on digital documents before sending them. The S6 Edge Plus can be customized so that the curved edges can quickly show your favorite apps or contacts by swiping from the sides. Both phones have 5.7-inch screens and support wireless power charging. While the phones are now available for ordering online, pricing and official release dates have yet to be announced. The new devices follow Samsung s April release of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which will soon get price cuts after the company reported earlier this month that its profit had declined for the seventh quarter in a row. Analysts say that Apple s introduction last year of big-screen phones, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as competition from Chinese handset makers like Xiaomi, are chipping into Samsung s profit. Samsung on Thursday also introduced its mobile wallet system, a rival to the Apple Pay system and Google s Android Pay. The new wallet, Samsung Pay, is similar to Apple and Google s offerings, and will work with a handful of previously released Samsung devices.
