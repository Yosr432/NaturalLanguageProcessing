Theranos is running out of time: When Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive officer of Theranos Inc., sat down for an interview last month, she sought to address reports that sparked serious doubts about her company's innovative blood-testing technology.  What we need to do now is focus on the technology and focus on the science and the data and put that out there,  Holmes said in an interview for a Bloomberg Businessweek cover story.  Because that speaks for itself. : Since then, investors, critics, and members of the medical community have been waiting. And waiting. And the news just keeps getting worse. The most recent blow comes from an inspection report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which found that Theranos's lab facility in Newark, Calif., is in violation of regulations on five counts. As Bloomberg News reported, the company's testing center inside a Walgreen's pharmacy in Palo Alto, Calif., has been temporarily shuttered and turned into a ghost town with a sign taped out front saying it's closed "until further notice." The company's response to this new crisis is the same as it has been all along: It says it is on top of it. How much longer it can keep saying this without losing its credibility is unclear, but it's safe to say that time is running out.Holmes and her story of upending the blood testing market were so powerful that Theranos was granted a $9 billion valuation through recent investment rounds and attracted a VIP roster of politically connected board members from outside the medical field, such as Henry Kissinger and William Perry. Theranos did much of its fundraising from 2003 to 2015, in the midst of an inflating Silicon Valley bubble, when billions of dollars in investor money was sloshing around. The environment has become much more difficult over the past six months, and the company may be running out of time.
