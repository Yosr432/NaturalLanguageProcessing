One year later, Alphabet is a tale of two Googles: Today marks the one year anniversary of the day Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin picked a new name and an audacious corporate structure in an attempt to spawn gigantic tech businesses in industries way beyond web search. So far, the year has been great for Google. Unshackled from the unprofitable moonshots, its balance sheet and steady ads business growth has reassured investors. The business soars: Revenues topped 21 percent growth last quarter and operating margins keep getting fatter. More focus: One senior exec at Google recently explained a key change from the Alphabet reorg: Before, meetings cluttered with discussion of extraneous projects   the self-driving cars, medical doodads and internet balloons. Now, Google meetings are spent on Google alone. Porat appeases Wall Street: Not too long ago, investors were making fretful phone calls about Google s abundant spending. Not anymore. Thank Ruth Porat, the former Morgan Stanley CFO who helped orchestrate the Alphabet reshuffle.  Implementing a competitive culture in what was becoming a behemoth   that s critical,  said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners.  Ruth Porat has been priced into the stock.  About that stock: It has climbed nearly 24 percent since August 10th of last year. It s been bumpier for  Other Bets,  the hodgepodge, ever-evolving group of companies outside of Google that Page and Brin desperately want to behave like lean, world-changing startups. Losses added: Alphabet poured $859 million into these units last quarter, nearly $300 million more than the same quarter last year. New equity: Employees at the non-Google company may soon have to get used to new stock packages   ones that aren t tied to that soaring Google.
