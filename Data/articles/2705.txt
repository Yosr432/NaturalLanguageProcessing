Snapdeal in India claims to be aggressively investing in assisted kiosks (similar news also from Kudo in Indonesia): Snapdeal is planning to set up assisted outlets across over 70,000 rural areas and 65 cities by the end of March 2015 in partnership with FINO PayTech, who has thousands of business correspondents on the ground, especially in rural areas. Under the partnership, Snapdeal.com is trying to expand its access to consumers in the hinterland with an assortment of over 1000 products through assisted kiosks which would be operated by FINO Paytech. This would enable the target segment to shop online. Apart from Dharavi, Varanasi, Valsad (Gujarat), urban villages of Noida, Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Jaipur are the targets of the e-commerce player to begin with. The company has already started the pilot project in these places. The products would be on display at the digital kiosks curated on an exclusive page requiring login by FINO agent, who would place an order, collect payment, receive and deliver to people who have no permanent address.  Together we aim to provide innovative, yet simple ways to reach and service those end-consumers who are still not exposed to the benefits of online shopping,  Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO Snapdeal.com said in a statement. FINO will assist in sales, payments and delivery of ordered products to customers through its network, he added.
