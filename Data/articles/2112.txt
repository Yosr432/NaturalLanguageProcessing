Zomato buys cloud-based PoS system; to help restaurants manage inventory, payments: Zomato.com, has acquired MapleGraph Solutions Pvt Ltd, which operated a point-of-sales business, for an undisclosed amount in what is its first acquisition outside its core business of restaurant listings and reviews, it said on Tuesday. Zomato is now launching its own version of the product under Zomato Base which would allow restaurants manage inventory and payments as well as provide real time analytics and more. The move would expand the revenue streams for Zomato, which currently draws bulk of its business from ads from restaurants. The firm has been looking at new ways to generate revenues and is starting an online food ordering and table reservation service. Zomato Base offers inventory and recipe management, analyses sales data to track restaurant s performance, generates electronic receipts, as well as does payment gateway integration and menu management. Delhi-based MapleGraph was founded in 2011 by Arun Tangri (earlier worked with Microsoft and IBM India), Varun Tangri, (also co-founded Tokkri.com and DealerConnect.in) and Abhishek Rohilla (previously worked with Unisys and Siemens Information Systems).  Technology has seen very little penetration in the restaurant industry, and we are excited to be driving this change at large scale,  said Arun Tangri, co-founder and CEO, MapleGraph.  There is a lot that can be done if we are able to build a technology platform that connects consumers to restaurants and vice versa, and we believe that a world-class cloud-based POS system is the first step towards building that platform,  said Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and CEO, Zomato. Zomato will work on integrating the POS product s services with the consumer product over the next few months. After the integration, Zomato will start offering Zomato Base to restaurant businesses across the world this fall.
