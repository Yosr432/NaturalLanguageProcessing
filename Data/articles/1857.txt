Hackers May Have Obtained Names of Chinese With Ties to U.S. Government. Chinese hackers who attacked the databases of the Office of Personnel Management may have obtained the names of Chinese relatives, friends and frequent associates of American diplomats and other government officials, information that Beijing could use for blackmail or retaliation. Federal employees who handle national security information are required to list some or all of their foreign contacts, depending on the agency, to receive high-level clearances. Investigators say that the hackers obtained many of the lists, and they are trying to determine how many of those thousands of names were compromised.  They are pumping this through their databases just as the N.S.A. pumps telephone data through their databases,  said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  It gives the Chinese the ability to exploit who is listed as a foreign contact. And if you are a Chinese person who didn t report your contacts or relationships with an American, you may have a problem.  Officials have conceded in the briefings that most of the compromised data was not encrypted, though they have argued that the attacks were so sophisticated and well hidden that encryption might have done little good.
