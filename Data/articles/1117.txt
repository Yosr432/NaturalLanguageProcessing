In a Self-Serve World, Start-Ups Find Value in Human Helpers: The Internet took off as a way to book travel because the human intermediaries were always a bit suspect   their expertise questionable, their methods opaque and their allegiances unclear. And at first, the machines seemed to improve everything. For uncomplicated trips, booking online is now much easier than in the past. Because we ve replaced agents with computers whose sole purpose is to ferret out the best deal, and for lots of other reasons, airfares have plummeted over the last three decades. Yet as you suffer through another holiday travel season, you might pause to consider how much we ve really gained   and lost   in ditching human agents for machines. And you might welcome an emerging trend on the Internet: start-ups that are trying to put human agents, whether in travel, home services or shopping, back at the center of how we make decisions.  A lot of companies pushed hard on the idea that technology will solve every problem, and that we shouldn t use humans,  said Paul English, the co-founder of a new online company called Lola Travel.  We think humans add value, so we re trying to design technology to facilitate the human-to-human connection.  Lola, which is currently open only in a limited prerelease version, has an unusual interface: When you re looking to book a trip, you just send a text. Your request can be vague    Hey, my family is thinking about going to Europe next summer    because on the other end sits a human. The agent knows your general travel preferences and has access to many of the same tools you d use to book a trip. But the agent also has something extra   experience and data to help make decisions about the kind of trip you should take.
