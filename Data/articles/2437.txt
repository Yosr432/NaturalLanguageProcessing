Apple is increasingly reliant on the iPhone however, as Macs and iPads become less important: Overall sales of iPhones shattered analysts  predictions. Apple said it sold 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter, as many as 12 million more than expected. The company s overall revenue, almost $75 billion, easily beat analysts  average estimates of $67.7 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. The company s shares, which have gained more than 50 percent in the last year, rose more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. Strong sales of Macs also contributed to the company s growth. The company said it sold 5.5 million of the computers in the quarter, up from 4.8 million in the same quarter of last year. But iPad sales continued to shrink. The company sold 21.4 million iPads in the quarter, down 18 percent from 26 million in the quarter a year ago. Increasingly, though, the company s fortunes rely on the iPhone. Sales of iPhones accounted for 69 percent of the company s revenue in the quarter, up from 56 percent in the same quarter a year ago.  A bet on Apple is increasingly a bet on the iPhone,  said Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.  The good news is, iPhones are great. The bad news is, right now that s driving over 100 percent of the revenue growth of the company.
