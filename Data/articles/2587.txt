Gift cards are the best gifts, research shows: the less specific the gift, the more it will be appreciated. The sad truth is that while gift cards constitute a minority of holiday gifts, according to the National Retail Federation, they have been the most popular gift request since 2007. In studies to be presented early next year at a conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, researchers tried to analyze the emotional turmoil churned up by the exchanging of gifts, noting that the giver s earnest intentions may often widely miss the mark of the recipient s true desires. The closer the relationship, the more thought givers believe they should put into selecting a gift. But when subjects were asked what they would like to receive, they overwhelmingly replied that they wanted credit-card gift cards, which would give them the flexibility to choose exactly what they want.
