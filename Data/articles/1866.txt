Microsoft drops the price of the Xbox One and introduces a 1TB console; will sell $25 adapter that allows streaming games from console to PC. Microsoft announced Tuesday that it's dropping the price of the 500 gigabite Xbox One to $349, which had previously been advertised as a "promotional" price drop from $399. Now, Microsoft will offer a new 1 terabyte model -- that's double the storage of the old standard model -- for $399 instead, the company said in a blog post. The Xbox is still locked in a battle with Sony's PlayStation to control the console world, and this is a clear play to appeal to hardcore gamers. As gaming guide Kotaku and others have reported, Sony is, in fact, expected to release a 1 TB version of the PlayStation soon. Microsoft also had some more news on its growing efforts to mix Xbox and PC gaming; a major feature of its upcoming operating system is that users can stream games from their console to their computer. To that end, Microsoft also announced it will sell a $25 adapter that will allow players to use their wireless controllers with their current computers. The company has redesigned the controller to allow players to plug their gaming headsets into the controller, which gives them the option to control settings such as the volume of their microphone or the game's audio while they play. Microsoft has also improved the quality of the sound that comes through the controller. The new controller doesn't mean, however, that you have to buy all new headsets or other accessories. "All existing controller accessories will work with the updated controller," the company said.
