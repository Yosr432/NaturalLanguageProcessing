Is the Tech Market Hitting Middle Age : First it was PCs. Now it s tablets. And very soon, it will be smartphones. Each of these markets has   or will   hit its peak in both revenue and unit shipments in short order. Each has moved (or will soon move) from the soaring grandeur of youth and young adulthood to the dowdiness of mature middle age. As these inevitable market developments occur, important shifts are starting to happen. Not only will device manufacturers and their key component suppliers have to evolve their businesses   as many have started to do   but very soon, so will companies offering software and services used by those devices. While some argue that these software and services companies are taking over the world, it s naive to think that their growth can be maintained completely independent of the devices. At a fundamental level, the two are linked, and when the device numbers peak, so too do the potential users of any software or service. Admittedly, there s more of a growth opportunity over the short term for these software and service companies, but that won t last forever, either. As with any major industry transformation, this means that some of the biggest industry players may not survive in their current form (or at all), while others are likely to go through some dramatic transformations. This also means that there will be tremendous opportunities for today s smaller or even yet-to-be started companies. The tech industry s transition to a more mature market does bring with it the opportunity for some potentially boring baggage when it comes to things like stagnant unit-growth rates. However, instead of viewing this as a midlife crisis, smart, innovative companies will figure out ways to see these developments as a midlife celebration that can open up new opportunities.
