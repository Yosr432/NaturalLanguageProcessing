Lyft raises $150M at valuation of $2.5B; Carl Icahn invests $100M: Lyft Inc. raised an additional $150 million, led by an investment of $100 million from billionaire Carl Icahn, raising the stakes in the car-hailing service s rivalry with Uber Technologies Inc. The fundraising will help Lyft in a battle for market share with the much larger Uber. A Lyft presentation to investors that was obtained by Bloomberg News in April showed mounting costs for marketing the service. Lyft projects a 512 percent jump in net revenue this year to $796 million. Lyft s other investors include Japan s Rakuten, China s Alibaba and the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The San Francisco-based company had a fourfold increase in active passengers on 2.2 million rides in December 2014 but growth was beginning to slow, the presentation for investors said. The document was prepared for a $530 million fundraising round announced in March that valued the company at about $2.5 billion.
