Facebook Will Start Sharing Ad Revenue With Video Creators: Facebook is offering video creators like the NBA, Fox Sports and Funny or Die a revenue split from ads sold alongside their videos beginning this fall. It s the first time Facebook has done any kind of revenue share around video, and the pitch to content creators is pretty transparent: Share your content with us and we ll share some of the money we make back with you. The move is a full-on attack against YouTube, which has dominated the digital video market for the better half of a decade. Facebook has been able to attract content creators because of its massive reach, but now it s offering them the one thing YouTube has offered for years: Money. YouTube also uses a revenue split to entice content creators   the same revenue split, actually   with 55 percent going to the video creator and the remaining 45 percent staying with the platform. But Facebook s argument is that it can get more eyeballs for your video. People don t have to hunt to find your video   Facebook will show it to them. And those people don t need to be following your Facebook Page, either. The revenue share on Facebook doesn t apply to all videos in News Feed. Instead, the company is rolling out a new feature called Suggested Videos, a News Feed of sorts that s exclusively video content. For example, if you click on a video in your News Feed about snowboarding, you ll be taken to the Suggested Videos feed where you can watch that video, then scroll down to see others that are similar. There will be ads in this stream   standalone, autoplay ads like you might find in News Feed   and this is where the revenue share comes into play.
