Mashable Fires News Staff, Replaces Executives as Part of Pivot to Video Infotainment: Last week, the digital publication Mashable said that it had raised $15 million in a funding round led by Turner and that it would be using the money to  co-develop  content for TBS and TNT. Today, the other shoe dropped. The company announced that it is replacing its chief content and revenue officers   Jim Roberts and Seth Rogin   and firing a large portion of its editorial staff. Additionally, Mashable is pivoting from hard news coverage; it will focus on producing lots more video about  digital culture.  According to Politico and a Mashable editor, 30 people were laid off.
