Why did Amazon send 405 reps to CES 2014  Why did Apple send just 4  The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is one of largest trade shows around: Amazon.com, the third-biggest consumer-electronics retailer in the U.S., sent 405 representatives to CES 2014. Apple, the fourth-biggest, sent four, according to the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on the conference.Back in 2009, when Amazon was only eighth among U.S. electronics retailers, it sent 69 reps to the annual nerd festival. Apple, then the third-largest electronics retailer, also sent 69 that year. Apple hasn t introduced a product at the dog and pony show in more than a decade after debuting a series of flops there in the 1990s, including a video-game console and the Newton but it had steadily increased its number of reps at CES from 2009 to 2011 as the company grew its retail operations. While Apple Stores mostly sell the company s brand-name products, it does carry accessories from other hardware makers. U.S. electronics sales at Apple Stores last year rose to more than $11 billion, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. But for some reason, Apple cut its badge count to four in 2012, where it s remained ever since. Apple didn t respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Amazon, which also didn t respond to a request for comment, sent more employees last year than Best Buy and Wal-Mart Stores, the top two gadget retailers. Amazon sells its own products, too, but it s a retailer first and foremost. If CES s influence in waning, nobody told Jeff Bezos.
