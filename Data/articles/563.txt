What to Do With Apple Cash  Irish Dilemma as EU Ruling Looms: As Ireland braces itself for a possible European Union order to claw back Apple Inc. s unpaid taxes, government officials warned Finance Minister Michael Noonan that he would face two crucial questions upon delivery of a ruling that could come  soon.  The first is whether to appeal at the EU s top court. The second, is what to do with the  large recovery amounts  pending the outcome. Ireland could be sitting on the cash for  several years,  according to a briefing note from last month published Wednesday. Amid growing speculation that Apple could be forced to pay back billions of euros of tax breaks, officials said they are preparing for the worst and that an adverse ruling  could have significant negative implications for Ireland, in terms of reputation and the creation of uncertainty around our tax system.
