Jet.com Will Launch With Amazon Prices Front and Center: Jet, the new shopping site that launches on Tuesday, promises shoppers  the lowest prices on everything.  To hammer home the point, the online mall will compare its price with Amazon s price on every one of its product pages. As a way to prove its marketing promise, Jet tested its service with some customers who were given early access by showing its prices against those found on multiple competing websites. But after some people were confused by the appearance of the various competitors, Jet has decided to show its prices against just one competitor, Amazon, which typically has very low prices.  So it ll be very easy for customers to understand that savings means savings compared to Amazon,  Jet CEO Marc Lore said of the changes in an interview on Monday.  They re clearly the dominant player, so they re a great reference point.  Lore said about 90 percent of Jet s product listings at launch will show Jet s discounted price compared with Amazon s lowest price for the same item. The remaining 10 percent of Jet product pages will be updated with Amazon price comparisons over the next two months. There are some caveats. While Amazon often has the lowest prices, it doesn t always. When that s the case, Jet will discount the product below the lowest price found elsewhere on the Web, but will still show Amazon s price for consistency s sake, the company said. The Amazon prices also won t factor in the fact that some of the products wouldn t carry shipping fees for Amazon customers who pay $99 a year for Amazon Prime. Jet, meanwhile, charges $5.99 for orders under $35, while Amazon also charges delivery for orders of this size for non-Prime members.  If you have Prime, you re not our target customer,  Lore said, explaining the rationale.  You re getting video, you re getting faster shipping. It s a completely different animal.
