Alibaba Finance Arm Is Valued Above $40 Billion in Latest Funding Round: Alibaba s finance affiliate, which runs China s biggest online payments business, closed a private placement valuing the unit at more than $40 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter. Ant Financial sold stakes to external investors, including China Development Bank Capital Company. China s National Social Security Fund has become a strategic investor, the finance arm said on its official microblog account, without giving details of the investment. The pension fund acquired about 5 percent. Ma spun off the finance operations into a new company he controls in 2011, citing the risk of foreign ownership restrictions. Yahoo and SoftBank held a majority of Alibaba at the time. Prior to Alibaba's record $25 billion IPO in September, the companies struck a new deal that entitled the e-commerce operator to a share of earnings at Ant Financial, which is moving into new businesses, including money-market funds. Alipay, which has more than 800 million registered users, is a service similar to PayPal. Alibaba is entitled to either a third of Ant Financial shares or a one-time payout equal to 37.5 percent of the equity value, according to Alibaba s IPO prospectus. Alibaba also holds perpetual claim to 37.5 percent of Ant Financial s pretax earnings until it receives a third of the financial arm s equity.
