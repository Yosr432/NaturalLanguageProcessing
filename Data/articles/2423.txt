Chinese government seems to back down on report criticized Alibaba: Hovering over the results was a white paper about Alibaba issued on Wednesday by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or S.A.I.C., a Chinese regulator. The letter said the agency had discovered  the long-term existence of illegal problems regarding the management of transaction activity and other issues.  The agency said that it presented findings to Alibaba executives in a July 17 meeting at the company s headquarters in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but that it had kept the results confidential at the time so as  not to affect Alibaba s preparations for a stock market listing.  Alibaba began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September. Though the end result of the S.A.I.C. investigation is not yet clear, by Thursday afternoon Alibaba appeared to have scored a victory against the regulator when the white paper was removed from the agency s website without explanation. In New York trading on Thursday, the company s shares closed more than 8 percent lower.
