LinkedIn is being sued over Reference Search: The LinkedIn service in question is called  Reference Search.  It is available only to premium account holders, who pay a monthly fee. An employer or recruiter can use it to generate a list of people in its own network who worked at the same company at the same time as a job candidate. It also allows premium members to use the site s messaging system to contact people who appear on those lists, without notifying a job candidate. In Sweet v. LinkedIn, a class-action suit filed last month in Northern California, the plaintiffs contended that LinkedIn, in providing the job reference material, enabled potential employers to  anonymously dig into the employment history of any LinkedIn member, and make hiring and firing decisions based upon the information they gather,  without ensuring that the information was accurate. This, they said, is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
