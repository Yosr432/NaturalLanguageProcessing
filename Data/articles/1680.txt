Etsy Surges Most Since IPO on Mention in Google Revenue Call: Etsy surged the most since it went public, after Google said the online artisan marketplace is seeing a boost in traffic from mobile-search results. Etsy gained 31 percent to $21.98 at the close in New York, the biggest climb since its IPO on April 16. The shares had increased 5.2 percent from the stock s debut through Thursday s close. Brooklyn-based Etsy, a platform where sellers offer homemade and vintage items ranging from jewelry to wall art, has been trying to boost sales after its first-quarter net loss widened. Google s  deep links,  which redirect users to mobile applications when they click results from a Web search, could help Etsy lure more shoppers to its marketplace. Developers like Etsy are already seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking,  Omid Kordestani, Google s chief business officer, said on an earnings phone call Thursday. Etsy s sudden spike may be creating what s called a short squeeze -- meaning traders who were betting against the company have to cover their positions at the higher price, leading to swings in the stock.
