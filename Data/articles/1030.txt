Xiaomi Misses Smartphone Sales Target by 10% on China Slowdown: Xiaomi Corp. sold more than 70 million smartphones last year, falling well short of its target and prompting founder Lei Jun to tell employees he was refocusing research efforts into  cool stuff  like robotics and virtual reality. The Chinese startup had a stated goal of selling 80 million devices. Xiaomi originally predicted selling 100 million units, but then changed that after China set its lowest growth target in 15 years and copycat vendors started taking away market share. The miss was a blow to company morale, Lei said in an e-mail to employees.  We set a target of 80 million and, before we knew it, it became an obligation,  Lei said.  We changed under this pressure, and everyone s faces gradually lost all traces of humor.  The smartphone maker was one of China s most exciting startup stories of past years, with a valuation of $45 billion that trailed only that of Uber Technologies Inc. Xiaomi thrived through online sales of budget-priced devices with advanced components, overtaking domestic competitors and challenging Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. for supremacy in the world s biggest market. Xiaomi s market share has been pinched by competitors including Huawei and Meizu, said Jeff Pu, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co. They are among the Chinese vendors that have flooded the Internet with ultra-thin phones offering similar features and prices to Xiaomi s Mi 4i and Redmi Note 2. Huawei said it shipped more than 100 million smartphones last year as it expanded in the U.S. and Europe, defying an industry slowdown. Pu expects Xiaomi s sales growth to slow to 10 percent this year.  With sales growth slowing, Xiaomi s valuation will be hurt,  Pu said.  It could even face a down round, as investors are less willing to pay.
