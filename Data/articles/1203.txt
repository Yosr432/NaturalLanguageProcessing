Successful Tech IPO#1: Shares of Square Soar by 45% After Public Offering: Square began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, at one point surging more than 64 percent above its initial public offering price of $9. It ended the day up 45 percent, closing at $13.07. The first-day pop followed a turbulent I.P.O. process for the six-year-old company, one that was marred by questions over pricing and valuation and that arrived in the face of a precarious public market for technology offerings. On Wednesday, when Square had priced its shares at $9, that was lower than the $11 to $13 range it had set, putting its valuation at $2.9 billion, well below the $6 billion price tag that private investors had valued the company at last year. As recently as Wednesday, advisers laid out options for Square including pulling the deal, three people briefed on the discussions said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, but for Square, that was not a consideration.   We have a great beginning,  said Jack Dorsey, Square s chief, striking an upbeat note in an interview on Thursday, which was his 39th birthday.  I don t see negativity as necessarily something that detracts from our work.  The I.P.O. ordeal illustrates the difficulties   some might say guesswork   of accurately valuing companies, both when they are private and when they go public. And Square, which closed its first day trading with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, now faces the challenge of moving on from the fund-raising event, solidifying its business and building itself up.  I want to get back to a steady state and back to business,  Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Square s strategy now was  to continue to save people trips to the bank. We re not going out there to say we re getting rid of the banks or card networks. We ve just put a much cleaner face on that infrastructure.
