LinkedIn built a new app for college kids - from which Lynda is missing: In an effort to lure more young people to its professional network, LinkedIn built a standalone app specifically for college students. The app helps students quickly create a profile (if they don t already have one), find career paths and job postings that relate to their major, and connect with alumni who studied the same topic. The app is appropriately named  LinkedIn Students.  LinkedIn s challenge is that its product is most useful once you already have a job. Or at least know a bunch of other people who do. Oftentimes, college students have neither, which makes the idea of creating a profile seem overwhelming, said Ada Yu, a product manager at LinkedIn. So LinkedIn is trying to appeal to young people with an app that s less cumbersome than its flagship app. LinkedIn users can already do most of what the college app offers in LinkedIn s main app; it s just more simplified now. Two things worth noting: Lynda.com, the online library of classes LinkedIn bought for $1.5 billion last year, is noticeably missing from the app. It seems likely that LinkedIn will add online classes to the app at some point. LinkedIn can make money from this app. Once students scroll past the daily job and alumni recommendations, they get to an  extra credit  section which will include some branded content. LinkedIn will launch with branded content from J.P. Morgan. What LinkedIn will not do, however, is recommend career paths or job openings in exchange for cash. All suggested jobs will be based on LinkedIn s algorithm, Yu said.
