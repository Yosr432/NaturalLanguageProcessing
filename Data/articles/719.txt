Facebook considers letting users add a tip jar to make money from posts: Facebook is exploring new ways for individual users to profit from their posts on the network, The Verge has learned. A user survey distributed this week hints at a broad range of ways that users could make money or promote a cause, including a tip jar, branded content and taking a cut of the ad revenue Facebook earns from posts. The survey also asked users to indicate their interest in a  call to action  button, a way to let followers make donations and a  sponsor marketplace  to match users with advertisers. It s unclear whether Facebook is considering making these options available to all users; the language of the survey indicated it is targeted at verified users. The survey was spotted on the page of a verified user with a relatively small following. (Okay, it was me.) Facebook does not currently offer individual users a way to earn money by posting on Facebook. It has allowed publishers to sell advertising inside its fast-loading Instant Articles format, and recently clarified rules allowing posts sponsored by brands to be shared by verified pages. Facebook is also testing ads within the suggestions that pop up after you watch a video, sharing money with publishers. But recently, the company has taken steps to make its publishing tools more widely available. In February, the company began letting anyone publish Instant Articles.
