India smartphone shipments (distinct from sales to end-customer) fell QoQ in Q4 2014 on holiday-related inventory buildup in Q3: For the first time ever, smartphone shipments fell in India during the last quarter of 2014. The smartphone market contracted by 4 percent, while the feature phone market plummeted by 14 percent in relation to the previous quarter, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). The 64.3 million units shipped by vendors to sales channels in Q4 2014 was also 5 percent lower than the number of phones shipped in the corresponding period of the previous year. This includes both smartphones and feature phones. It s worth noting here that the contraction was in shipments from phone vendors, and not necessarily in phone sales from retailers. The main reason for the drop in shipments has been attributed to the big inventories built up with sales channels during the third quarter. That was due to the strong surge in sales during the festive season. While the overall phone market contracted by 11 percent quarter-to-quarter, the decline was mainly in feature phones. On the positive side, smartphones formed 35 percent of the overall mobile phone business in Q4 2014, compared to a 13 percent share in the same quarter a year earlier. This confirms a strong shift from feature phones to smartphones. Samsung maintained its leadership position in Q4 2014, with Apple presenting stiff competition, but  online exclusive  brands like Xiaomi are making big inroads in the value-for-money category. Homegrown vendor Micromax shipped fewer phones in Q4 2014 owing to high inventories pumped into sales channels during the previous quarter in the festive season.
