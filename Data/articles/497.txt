Five days of Etsy payment processing outages have merchants flipping: Those hoping to snag some handmade July 4th cookies and home-made vegan sunblockmight have woken up to an empty stomach and sunburn after a serious payment processing outage on e-commerce site Etsy. Over the last five days, a large number of Etsy transactions have been disrupted by  third party  payment processing outages. As of 6pm PST July 5th, over 4,000 messages of frustration have been posted in the company s Bugs Community Forum. After the Direct Checkout outage, many merchants were left with their hands in their laps explaining delays to buyers. The outage is especially tough for sellers who have to face angry customers. It s all too easy for an unhappy buyer to blame the seller in a negative review for an outage out of their control.
