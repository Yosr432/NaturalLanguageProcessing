A respected commentator asks - How many people really care about Google Services  "I ask these questions because when looking at the future of Android and of Google, Gmail, maps, calendar, Google Now and all the other Google Services come up a lot. They come up both as indicators of Google's strength and as levers for Google to retain power of Android OEMs, since it can withhold these services from a device more or less at will. I, and the kind of people who spend time thinking about these issues, tend to assume that, well, maps and calendars and email and so on are very important, because we use them all day, and that the tight integration of Google services is a good reason to buy an Android phone and their absence would make it unsalable. What I wonder, then, is how much one can say that these Google services are very broad but very shallow. They address a need that a small number of people feel very deeply but that many more people may feel only occasionally, if ever. We know, for example, that the typical Gmail user gets five emails a day, 'mostly commercial'. How committed are they to Google  The obvious exception here is an app store - but this is one area where it might be possible to make an alternative without having Google's vast machine learning engine as a back-end - Amazon has tried, and in China (where Google is effectively absent) there are at least half a dozen."
