A Year Later, $19 Billion For WhatsApp Doesn t Sound So Crazy: Without WhatsApp, Facebook s international situation would look a lot dicier. And if a competitor like Google acquired it instead, it could have been disastrous. Instead, Facebook possess the most popular messaging app, and has neutralized the biggest threat to its global domination of social networking. No apps get opened as often as messaging apps. While you might spend longer in total scrolling through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Pinterest, the frequent short sessions with chat apps make them a vector for other experiences. That means they re more valuable than they might first appear. How do you monetize chat  It s a tough question. Sure there s stickers, but there s too much competition to charge much upfront for an app and its too interruptive to show ads. But platforms, hubs, portals   whatever you want to call them   hold plenty of opportunities to cash in. The messaging apps from Asia are proving this as we speak. China s WeChat also lets you call a taxi, pay friends, search, shop, buy movie tickets, and more. Japan s Line hosts Line Pay, Line TV, and an identity platform for games. Why fumble with a bunch of different apps, passwords, and payment methods when you can do it all while you chat  Even Snapchat is expanding far beyond messaging. Its Stories product for broadcasting sequences of photos and videos is a hit with star content creators. Its Snapcash feature lets you quickly pay friends through Square Cash. And its new Discover portal collects Snap-formatted content from premium producers like Comedy Central, CNN, ESPN, and Vice. A lot of critics wondered how Facebook could earn money from messaging on WhatsApp, considering it s vowed not to show ads and only charges its skimpy $1 subscription fee in a few markets. The answer is it doesn t have to. By taking a cut of commerce, or charging for promotion of content, it could keep chat lean and clean while monetizing other parts.
