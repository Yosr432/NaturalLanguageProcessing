GoPro delays its highly anticipated drone until winter: GoPro announced its first-quarter earnings today, and the details were fairly bleak. It saw its revenue drop by 49.5 percent from the same period in 2015, and it swung from a $22 million profit to a $121 million loss. The company also announced that its new drone, the Karma, will be delayed until the winter holiday. It was originally slated to be released in the first half of this year. The news comes after a disappointing year for GoPro. While the company shipped more cameras than ever before in 2015 (6.6 million), GoPro had a rough fourth quarter, bringing in about $200 million less than it did in the fourth quarter of 2014.
