EBay Reports Sale of Enterprise Unit as Earnings Beat Estimates: EBay is sailing into the split of its two businesses   PayPal payments and its online marketplace   with a reassuring show of strength as its second-quarter financial performance surpassed Wall Street forecasts. With its PayPal business to be spun off at the end of this week, eBay also did some last-minute corporate cleanup Thursday morning. The company announced that it was selling its eBay Enterprise unit, which handles warehousing and logistics for third-party sellers, for $925 million to an investors consortium led by two private equity firms, Permira and Sterling Partners. Both eBay s profits and revenue were better than expected, after taking into account the sale of its warehouse and logistics arm. Shares in eBay, which reported its results before the stock market opened, were up about 3 percent in midday trading. The company s revenue increased 7 percent from the year-earlier quarter to $4.38 billion. The reported revenue fell short of analysts  average estimate of $4.49 billion. In the quarter, eBay pulled out the revenue from eBay Enterprise. If included, total revenue would have been $4.65 billion, above Wall Street forecasts. The split-up strategy is the byproduct of a drawn-out proxy fight with Carl C. Icahn, an activist investor, who advocated a PayPal spinoff. His pressure and logic prevailed, and the company declared in September that it planned to break itself up.
