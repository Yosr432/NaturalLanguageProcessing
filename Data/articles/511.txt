Amazon Expands Items on Dash Buttons as Order Rate Doubles: Amazon.com Inc. has added more than 50 new brands to its Dash Button service for instantly reordering everyday items, citing a doubling in the frequency of orders over the last three months. After introducing the WiFi-connected plastic tabsthat can be mounted to the fridge, washing machine or kitchen cupboard in 2015, the online retailing giant has steadily increased the number of brands available for replenishment to more than 150, Amazon said in a statement Thursday. Amazon also expanded its product categories to include toys, such as Play-Doh and NERF darts and added new items like Campbell s Soup and Cascade dishwashing soap. Members of Amazon Prime, which offers free two-day delivery on many items, are placing orders at a pace of more than twice a minute, Amazon said, up from once a minute three months ago. Total orders increased more than 70 percent in the last three months.
