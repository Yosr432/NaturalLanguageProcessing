Amazon is going to open an actual bricks-&-mortar retail store in New York. The Manhattan space will contain a selection of inventory to accommodate local same-day delivery and shoppers who want to pick up products bought online, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited unnamed sources. Amazon was also mulling over the idea of using the space as a showroom for its gadgets, such as Kindle e-readers and Fire smartphones, the report said. A successful trial could persuade the company to open stores in other cities around the country, the Journal said. The retailer has set up metal lockers around the country in places like 7-Eleven stores so people can conveniently pick up packages. Link
