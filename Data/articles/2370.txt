Several of the best-funded startups in Singapore are struggling; rocket startup Lazada is the one unicorn on the list:  1. Lazada, US$686 million: The fashion ecommerce retailer is one of Rocket Internet s greatest successes so far, and is the only unicorn on this list with a valuation of US$1.25 billion. Thanks to its recent shift to a marketplace model for third-party merchants, Lazada s sales   or gross merchandise volume (GMV)   doubled in the second half of 2014 as compared to the former half, bringing its total GMV for that year to roughly US$274.2 million. 2. Zalora, US$238 million: The other Rocket Internet-backed startup on the list, Zalora s last-seen numbers aren t exactly rosy. According to leaked documents, it had a net negative income of US$91 million in 2012, expecting to reach profitability by 2015.  3. iCarsClub, US$70.5 million: A peer-to-peer car rental platform is a great idea in Singapore, given the high costs of car ownership here. Nailing the execution, however, is a whole different ballgame, and iCarsClub has received some negative publicity in 2014 regarding just that. Still, having a war chest at its disposal will certainly help if it is directed in the right direction. iCarsClub and its Beijing-based spinoff PPzuche now have over 120,000 private cars available in their databases. 4. PropertyGuru, US$53 million: Online property classifieds are a hotly-contested industry in Southeast Asia, but somehow PropertyGuru have managed to stay ahead of the pack. In Singapore, 99.co is the latest challenger. CEO Steve Melhuish had revealed a couple of years ago that the company might go public, but nothing has happened since then. 5. Reebonz, US$40 million, 6. Bubbly, US$39 million, 7. MyRepublic, US$37.5 million, 8. Migme, US$34.6 million , 9. Wego, US$34.5 million, 10. Viki, US$24.3 million
