Tencent invests in Blink a Chinese Snapchat variant; investment in a potential rival could be to pre-empt competition: Tencent has made a new social play in the same vein as Snapchat to appease China s  post-90s  youths. The web giant made a fresh US$20 million series A investment into Blink, a new photo sharing and messaging app out of China. Sequoia Capital, H Capital, ZhenFund, and Innovation Works also participated in the round, according to Techweb.Tencent became king of China s online social messaging sphere with the mass adoption of QQ Messenger and kept the throne when it unleashed WeChat. But even though QQ earlier this year boasted a record 200 million concurrent users and WeChat s growth is only now starting to show signs of saturation, the web giant is actively looking for the next big thing for young people who no longer think WeChat is cool.
