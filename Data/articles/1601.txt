Fitbit Declines on Margin Concerns in First Post-IPO Report: Fitbit shares dropped as much as 16 percent in late trading after the company, which makes wearable fitness trackers, posted narrower margins in its first earnings report following an initial public offering. Second-quarter gross margin, a measure of profitability, narrowed to 47 percent in the second quarter from 51 percent a year earlier. Revenue more than tripled to $400.4 million, and profit before certain items was 21 cents a share, San Francisco-based Fitbit said Wednesday in a statement. The company, which dominates the market for fitness bands that monitor health data such as activity and sleep patterns, said it sold 4.5 million devices in the quarter. Costs to boost manufacturing capacity as well as slimmer profits on fast-selling newer products led to the gross margin decline, said Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson. Fitbit shares slipped as low as $43.25 following the report, after initially jumping as high as $56.48. They rose 3.9 percent to $51.64 at the close in New York. The company went public on June 17 at $20 a share.  This is a stock that had reached nosebleed levels,  he said.  But it s hard to argue with a company that s growing 250 percent.
