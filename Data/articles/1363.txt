Samsung Seen Tapping $55 Billion Cash Pile for Share Buyback:  Investors in Samsung Electronics are watching their holdings plunge as new Galaxy smartphones get a lukewarm public response. With $55 billion in cash, the company may be poised to offer consolation. Analysts expect the world s biggest smartphone maker to buy back shares as early as this month in an effort to return some value to stockholders. Removing more than $1 billion of stock from the market could prompt shares to rally by as much as 20 percent, according to the top-ranked analyst covering Samsung, potentially erasing their declines this year. Samsung has lost about $25 billion in market value -- roughly equivalent to a Nintendo  -- this year as sales of the S6 and Note 5 devices sputter against new models from Apple  and Chinese makers. A buyback would be just the second in eight years and may take the sting out of sliding market share and sales projected to hit their lowest since 2011.  A share buyback should happen anytime now because the earnings haven t been performing well,  said Dongbu Securities s Yoo Eui Hyung, who tops Bloomberg Absolute Return rankings for his calls on Samsung Electronics. The possibility of a Samsung buyback comes after the government imposed a 10 percent tax on chaebol conglomerates  income unless their spending meets certain minimum levels. The measures are aimed at pushing chaebol to increase salaries and boost investment.
