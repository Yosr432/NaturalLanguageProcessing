Amazon's AWS business is slowing, facing commoditization and increasing competition from Microsoft and Google:Sales growth at AWS has been declining. AWS is categorized in Amazon s financial statements in  North America, Other.  That grouping brought in $1.34 billion in the third quarter, up from $960 million a year ago. Yet sales growth fell to 39 percent from a year earlier, down from 57 percent a year before. The cloud industry has become increasingly competitive this year, with Google Inc. and Microsoft slashing costs of their offerings and boosting cloud products. Earlier this month, Google said it was reducing the price of some cloud features -- including storage and networking options -- by 23 percent to 79 percent. Microsoft has also trimmed prices this year and last month said it was increasing cloud services with packages of hardware and software.  Commodification is kind of washing at the foundations of what they do,  said Carl Brooks, an analyst with 451 Group. Amazon remains the dominant cloud provider, with a 27 percent share of the worldwide market for cloud infrastructure services, according to a report last month from Synergy Research Group Inc. Microsoft has around 10 percent, while International Business Machines Corp. has 7 percent.
