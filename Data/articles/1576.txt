Branch8 Lets Merchants Sell Via Multiple E-Commerce Sites With Fewer Headaches: Choice and competition is good for consumers, but it sure makes things tricky for merchants. Assuming that you want to reach shoppers through as many touchpoints as possible (you do), then you re going to be using a handful of e-commerce sites to sell your stuff in Asia. Beyond just spending time on different sites and dashboards, that means you ll be managing tricky issues   like inventory, demand, outbound packages and more   manually across a range of different (competing) websites. That s basically a whole separate job in itself. Indeed, that s what the founders of one new startup, Branch8, believe. With their service, they are aiming to make a difference and make selling across many sites something that any merchant can do with ease. Beyond consolidating the basic processes beyond selling via multiple services   Amazon, Lazada, Rakuten, eBay and Jumia are among the initial platforms supported   Branch8 also provides analytics to track traffic, it automates price checking and product migration, and connects to third-party logistics services. Those value-adds, Chan said, are where it believes it can really stand out for merchants.  Our differentiator is analytics,  he told TechCrunch in an interview.  Few tools track traffic via SKU. While our price tracking tool and the convenience of migrating to new platforms, this process is very manual, are specifically designed to meet merchants  pain-points.  The service is initially free to use for three months, after which a subscription-based pricing model kicks in. Packages begin at $315 per month, rising to $715 for merchants with larger product ranges and more intensive customer service requirements.
