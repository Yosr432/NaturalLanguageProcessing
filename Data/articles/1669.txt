Yahoo Posts Loss, Despite Rise in Its Display Ad Business: Yahoo s revenue in the second quarter rose 15 percent, the company said on Tuesday. But it spent heavily to achieve the gains, wiping out all of its profits and then some. For the quarter, Yahoo reported revenue of $1.24 billion, up 15 percent from the $1.08 billion it reported in the same quarter last year. But after deducting the share paid to partners, revenue was flat. The company posted a net loss of $22 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with the profit of $270 million, or 26 cents a share, it reported a year ago. Executives also warned that expenses would continue to be high through the rest of the year.  We are investing heavily to grow market share through traffic acquisition,  Marissa Mayer, Yahoo s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors to discuss the results. Yahoo shareholders were unimpressed, sending the company s stock down more than 1 percent in after-hours trading. Not that Yahoo s core business   selling advertising   matters much to investors right now. Wall Street is far more interested in the fate of the company s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, China s biggest e-commerce company. Yahoo plans to spin off the holdings, worth more than $30 billion, into a separate company called Aabaco Holdings in the fourth quarter. The deal is designed to avoid incurring a capital-gains tax bill, but Wall Street analysts are concerned that the Internal Revenue Service will reject Yahoo s argument that the spinoff should be tax-free.
