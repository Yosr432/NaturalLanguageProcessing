Don t want your startup to fail  Arianna Huffington tells founders to go to bed: Sleep deprivation is the undoing of startup founders, according to Arianna Huffington.  There is this kind of founder myth that if you are a founder you can t afford to get enough sleep,  she told me over the phone while catching a plane back to New York.  The truth is three-quarters of startups fail and if founders got more sleep they d have a better chance of succeeding.  Wanting to get more sleep isn t the problem for most of us. It s fitting in the recommended seven to 9 hours of sleep with work, eating, exercise, relationships and a social life   and on top of that founders need to spend a lot of time growing their fledgling company. The advice is obvious   no caffeine after 2 pm and keep your bedroom dark and quiet   but like exercise and eating right, a lot of us probably don t do it anyway. And sacrifices will be made   no tech in the bedroom and you might not get through all of those critically acclaimed Netflix dramas   Arianna tells me she s only seen one episode of House of Cards because sleep is the priority. But then, maybe you ll think clearly and your startup won t fail.
