IBM revenue fall dims upbeat profit forecast: International Business Machines Corp reported its 19th straight quarter of declining revenue, but forecast full-year earnings above Wall Street estimates due to growth in newer areas such as cloud-based services and analytics. However, investments to drive growth in the cloud business and the company's shift to a subscription-based as-a-service model hit its operating gross margin by 1.8 percentage points to 51 percent in the fourth quarter. IBM's shares were down 2.5 percent at $162.70 after rising briefly in extended trading. The company's revenue fell 1.3 percent to $21.77 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, but beat analysts' expectations of $21.64 billion. Net income rose to $4.50 billion, or $4.72 per share, from $4.46 billion, or $4.59 per share, helped partly by a lower tax rate. IBM's shares rose 30.2 percent in the last 12 months, outperforming the 23.2 percent gain in the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average.
