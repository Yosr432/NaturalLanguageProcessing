LinkedIn Shares Slip on Concerns Lynda Buy Masks a Slowdown: LinkedIn shares fell after the company attributed a bump in its annual revenue forecast to its acquisition of the education website Lynda.com, raising concerns that growth is slowing in its main business. LinkedIn said full-year sales would be about $2.94 billion, beating the $2.91 billion average of analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg. As part of the forecast, the company more than doubled expectations for revenue from the Lynda.com acquisition to $90 million for the year, raising questions about whether the professional-networking website s core business was expected to slow. The company acquired Lynda.com for $1.5 billion while it also reorganized its sales force and changed advertising methods -- expensive moves that may take time to produce benefits. The Lynda.com purchase and LinkedIn s efforts to promote news content are intended to make the website valuable to people even when they aren t looking for jobs. LinkedIn initially rose as much as 15 percent in extended trading after the earnings were released, only to erase those gains and fall as low as 9 percent to $207 during the company s conference call with investors. Second-quarter sales increased 33 percent to $711.7 million, while analysts  estimated $679.9 million. LinkedIn s loss widened to $67.7 million, or 53 cents, from $1.03 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, the Mountain View, California-based company said. LinkedIn s Talent Solutions business was its fastest-growing segment in the quarter, gaining 38 percent to $433 million after the sales force shake-up. The jobs site, which reported 380 million users, said those people spent 60 percent more time on LinkedIn than they did a year earlier. The company reduced the amount of e-mails it sends out by 40 percent to reduce complaints and improve the quality of the experience. The company said its China-based site now has more than 10 million members.
