Line Rises in Initial Public Offering, Cheering Skittish Tech Industry: The Line Corporation, the owner of a Japanese instant messaging app with a colorful cast of cartoon characters, cheered the technology industry on Thursday when its shares jumped 30 percent in their American trading debut. The strong showing offers hope for tech firms and their financial backers that Wall Street investors are warming up to closely held technology start-ups. But experts say Line is an unusual case of an established company with operating heft and a proven way to gin up sales   something that many new tech companies lack. Line itself still faces considerable hurdles, such as slowing user growth and an untested plan to use advertising to help make it profitable. Line s American depositary shares, priced at $32.84 each on Monday, jumped to $42.70 in early trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is expected to begin trading in Japan on Friday. Line s debut coincided with another new high for the equity markets in the United States. The Standard & Poor s 500-stock index has surged 8 percent since June 27, after Britain s decision to leave the European Union roiled stocks worldwide, as investors anticipated additional stimulus from central banks.
