The massive hacker attack on Sony, possibly by groups linked to North Korea, continues to dominate headlines; security flaws exposed: North Korea says its supporters may be behind Sony attack:The attack shut down most of the studio's network for more than a week and hackers have released sensitive data over the Internet, including employee salaries and Social Security numbers along with high-quality digital versions of several unreleased films. A key weakness was that few security measures existed between the computers of the Japanese company s divisions around the world, so hackers could move with relative ease throughout the corporation, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the information is confidential. The most recent attacks suggests Sony hasn t done enough since the last episode. The company put itself and others at risk by not putting passwords or encryption on the files that would have made them more difficult for hackers to open, according to Todd Feinman, chief executive officer of Identity Finder LLC, a New York-based provider of data management software.
