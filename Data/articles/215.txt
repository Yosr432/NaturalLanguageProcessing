Silicon Valley s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger: Mr. Trump s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its embrace-the-world approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump s actions  are so un-American it pains us all  and that  it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.  Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point.  We must stand with those who are affected,  he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.
