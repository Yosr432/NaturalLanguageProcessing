Managing Developers: Just Because You re In Charge Doesn t Mean You re In Control. The great irony of management is that the higher up you go, the less actual control you have. When you are but a humble coder, you make the computer do exactly what you want; when you re a manager, you only hope that people understand what you want, and then trust/pray that they do it both correctly and in a timely manner. The Shit Work Is Your Work. Basically a manager s job is to make other people more productive. What s one really good way to do that  Do the work that is getting in their way. Which means: find out what kind of important work your developers dislike the most, and do it for them. Don't BS. Unfortunately, as you probably already know, people suck. People flake, screw up, ignore you, pester you, disappear, quit, and/or lose faith in you, frequently for no good reason. But you know how people   surprisingly   often don t suck  Not to get all wifty and woo on you, but this was the most surprising lesson of my professional career: once people learn that they can trust you, then you can usually trust them back. So don t bullshit anyone, ever.
