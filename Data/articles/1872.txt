Alibaba s Jack Ma Visits U.S. to Lure Businesses Into China As Domestic Growth Sputters. Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma will visit New York and Chicago this week, seeking to pitch China s middle class as a growth opportunity for American business and his e-commerce company. Ma is looking for revenue beyond China, where the nation s economy is projected to grow at its slowest pace since 1990. One strategy is to position Alibaba as a cross-border e-commerce solution, enabling China s 557 million Internet users to buy things from anywhere in the world. Alibabas chairman is scheduled to arrive Monday in New York City and plans a dinner with leaders of select global brands, the company said. His calendar on Tuesday includes lunch with members of the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf-Astoria New York. Already, Costco and Macy s Inc. are among U.S. companies reaching Chinese shoppers through Alibaba. Ma has set a goal of raising the company s revenue from outside China to 50 percent from the current 4 percent. Cross-border sales into China and sales through Alibaba platforms to consumers outside China would constitute international revenue. Shares of Alibaba fell 2.7 percent to $88.29 in New York on Monday, extending this year s decline to 15 percent.
