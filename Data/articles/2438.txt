Apple is getting consumers to pay more for phones even as industry trends move in the other direction: Apple's sales figures are all the more impressive because they come at a time when the worldwide market for expensive smartphones is dropping. According to research from the Consumer Electronics Association, the average selling price of a smartphone has fallen from $440 to an expected $275 in just five years. The full price of the cheapest iPhone is $649. In fact, the average price of an iPhone actually went up, thanks to the popularity of the iPhone 6 Plus, which starts at $749. That's right; Apple's actually getting us to pay more for our phones. (Of course, most are purchased at subsidized prices through wireless carriers).
