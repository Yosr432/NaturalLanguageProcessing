Israel to Levy New Taxes on Google, Facebook in Policy Shift: Israel has expanded its definition of who must pay taxes on commerce, targeting digital multinationals such as Facebook Inc. and Google that critics say get a free ride. Because much of today s trade is carried out on the Internet, a foreign firm may now be considered a  permanent establishment  and subject to tax even if most of its presence is virtual, the Israel Tax Authority said in an e-mailed statement. The authority said Internet multinationals will be required to pay value-added tax, which is 17 percent for Israelis. The new taxes, which take effect immediately, will eventually add hundreds of millions of shekels a year to state revenue, the authority said. A Google representative in Israel couldn t immediately be reached for comment. Facebook  pays taxes according to the law in every country it operates, including Israel,  a spokeswoman said via e-mail. Although Israel s relatively small population of 8.5 million means the new taxes won t clobber the international giants, they build on broader efforts worldwide to level the playing field between foreign Internet companies and local commerce. Russia is pushing to raise taxes on U.S. Internet companies to help its local industry and governments across Europe and beyond are trying to extract more revenue from Google, Apple Inc. and other multinationals with increasingly complex billing and ownership structures.
