Shazura: A More Efficient Way to Search Images: While most image-search software finds photos using keywords or phrases, Shazura s binary system behaves more like the human brain, visually matching images that look the same with greater speed and efficiency. P rez de la Coba, an electrical engineer by training, began coding Shazura in 2011 out of frustration. She d snapped a photo of a pair of shoes she wanted but had trouble finding them online with existing image-comparison services such as Google s. Upload a file, outline what you want to search for, and Shazura s algorithm converts the image to a lengthy  numeric signature  containing extensive descriptive information. The number for a willow, say, is distinct from that for a cypress, or a green bag from a blue one. By cutting out the intermediary translation steps, Shazura sifts through a customer s image database more quickly and accurately and uses less computing power than traditional search engines. Without having to rely on keyword tags or extensive if-then instructions, Shazura can make large-scale image searches much easier for government agencies, advertisers, or social networks, says P rez de la Coba. Shazura has raised $1.2 million from investors and so far the 10-employee company has licensed its technology to clothiers El Corte Ingl s and RichRelevance.
