Facebook Adds Buy Button Integration As It Continues To Reinvent Pages: It s been over a year since Facebook started testing its buy button in ads on the newsfeed, and it appears that the company is now ready to take the service to its next logical progression with dedicated shops on Pages where users can browse for and purchase items. This is a pretty major step in Facebook s marked plans to take over ecommerce and turn pages into destinations where users can go to grab the information they need and make quick orders. With Facebook s recent efforts of adding business hours and OpenTable integrations, it s clear that the shop feature is the next step towards making Pages a more visible part of the user experience. The newsfeed has dominated how users have absorbed information from businesses on Facebook for the past decade. Now, it seems the company is ready to revitalize Facebook Pages and transform them into commerce destinations where users can not only quickly grab business info, but as of today, also buy stuff. Today, Facebook made a pretty clear statement that Pages is shifting to become a major priority for them in terms of user traffic. BuzzFeed reported that the company had recently started testing shops with  buy buttons  inside of Facebook Pages.
