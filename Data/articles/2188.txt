Porat, 57, will leave Morgan Stanley in April after 28 years at the firm, the New York-based company said Tuesday in a memo to employees. Jonathan Pruzan, 46, co-head of global financial institutions banking, will become Morgan Stanley s new CFO. Porat, one of Wall Street s most senior female executives, pivots from a job in which she built up cash reserves for safety to one where she must figure out how to use Google s growing cash pile. In five years as Morgan Stanley s CFO, the Stanford University alumna has helped stabilize an investment bank that almost collapsed in 2008.  I m delighted to be returning to my California roots and joining Google,  Porat said in a statement released by the Mountain View, California-based Internet company.  Growing up in Silicon Valley, during my time at Morgan Stanley and as a member of Stanford s board, I ve had the opportunity to experience first-hand how tech companies can help people in their daily lives. I can t wait to roll up my sleeves and get started. Silicon Valley has tapped Wall Street bankers to help them manage the finances associated with their rapid growth. Twitter Inc. last year named Anthony Noto, 46, previously Goldman Sachs Group Inc. s co-head of technology, media and telecommunications banking, as its CFO.
