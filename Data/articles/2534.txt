Bad news for Google #2: Facebook video is freaking YouTube out (Also, 65% of Facebook's Video Views Are Now on Mobile Devices) Here are the other numbers the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company released in a blog post: In the last 12 months, the number of video posts per Facebook user has increased 75 percent globally and 94 percent in the United States. Internationally, clips from consumers and marketers in the newsfeed have risen 3.6 times year over year. On average, more than 50 percent of U.S. users who visit Facebook daily watch at least one video. From a HawkPartners study commissioned by Facebook that surveyed 2,418 Facebook users in the U.S., 76 percent said Facebook is the place where they most often discover videos. Other choices included YouTube, "directly from a friend," Google, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and others.  While self-reported, the numbers lend themselves to a narrative that emerged at the end of 2014: Facebook has given Google's YouTube serious cause for concern after the latter dominated the online video space for years. Facebook is also evidently attempting to poach YouTube talent. "Google is freaking out," a media agency executive recently told Adweek.
