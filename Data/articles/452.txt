Startup Deal Activity Keeps Falling Worldwide: According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, global deal activity for venture capital-backed startups continued a decline in the second quarter after hitting record levels one year ago. In fact, at the current rate, deal activity will just barely top 2013 s numbers. "Many of the high-profile tech [initial public offerings] from 2015 continue to trade well below their initial offering price, putting pressure on private company valuations," said Brian Hughes of KPMG. "This, combined with economic concerns in China and Europe, has continued to put a damper on VC investment." "It's a challenging time for VC investors," he concluded.The reason funding moved higher while deal activity dropped is that some larger startups such as those of Snapchat Inc., Didi Chuxing, and Uber Technologies Inc. all saw huge rounds, accounting for much of the funding. In fact, in North America, Uber and Snapchat accounted for more than $4.5 billion of the $17.1 billion in total investment.And while there might have been more billion dollar companies minted in the second quarter than in the first, there were yet again more "down events" companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuation than there were unicorns created. According to the report, seven startups reached the unicorn club in the past four months, but CB Insights  downround tracker shows that 17 failed to live up to expectations and experienced down events over that time. Unicorn creation saw its most recent peak in the third quarter of last year, when 25 were birthed.
