Foxconn Unit Seeks the Next Xiaomi in India: For FIH Mobile Ltd., being the unit of Foxconn Technology Group that doesn t make iPhones has been a challenge. Its former name, Foxconn International Holdings Ltd., was constantly being confused with the parent, while its business model was tied to fading phone labels including Nokia and Sony. So it changed both. Two years later, FIH has a new marquee client in fast-growing smartphone brand Xiaomi Corp. and vastly-improved earnings. In anticipation of shipments climbing 50 percent this year, it s now looking to India in its hunt for the next big thing after profit doubled in 2014. FIH will assemble its first smartphones in India before the end of this year, prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi s decision to raise import tariffs, Tong said. The company will have multiple sites in the country, none employing more than 10,000 workers, he said.  We still see the growth rate will be in the emerging market brands,  he said. India could see smartphone sales of 85 million to 100 million this year in a region where emerging Asia-Pacific markets will collectively outpace China over the next four years, Tong said, citing figures from Gartner Inc.
