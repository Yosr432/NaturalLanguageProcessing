Operating profit of RMB 7.5 billion (US$1.2 billion), up 56 percent year-on-year. Value-added service revenues saw revenues of RMB 16.5 billion (US$2.6 billion), up 38 percent on Q3 2013. Gaming revenues from WeChat and QQ (the desktop and mobile IM app) reached RMB 2.6 billion (US$423 million), but there s no breakdown specific just to WeChat s gaming platform. QQ hit 819.8 million MAUs, up just 0.5 percent year-on-year. WeChat messaging app now has 468.1 million active users (MAUs) in Q3 2014. That s up from 438 million MAUs in Q2.
