Russian Authorities Rule Google Broke Antitrust Regulations:  Russian antitrust authorities ruled on Monday that Google broke the country s competition rules, adding to the regulatory headaches the search giant is facing worldwide. Russian officials said that Google had abused its dominant market position with Android, its mobile operating system, by favoring the company s own services over those of rivals, including Yandex, a Russian competitor. Earlier this year, Yandex had complained to the country s competition authority that cellphone manufacturers were not able to include the company s rival digital offerings in the Android operating system. After the complaint, the regulator began investigating whether Google unfairly bundled its own services, like digital maps, in its Android software. Unlike in other parts of the world, where Google has outmuscled domestic search rivals, Yandex still holds more than a 50 percent market share in Russian online search, according to industry statistics. The company s share price rose more than 8 percent in early afternoon trading in New York after the regulatory decision was announced.  Russia is the first jurisdiction to have officially recognized these practices as anticompetitive,  Yandex said in a statement, in reference to Google s favoring of its own services in Android over those of rivals. The company added that it believed the antitrust ruling would  serve to restore competition in the market.  European and other international antitrust watchdogs are taking an increasingly tough line against the company.
