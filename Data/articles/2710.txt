Uber in India has tied up with local mobile payments provider Paytm to sort out its problem with the RBI. Uber has been sweating in India ever since local taxi services complained to the RBI that Uber was violating Indian foreign exchange regulations by routing credit card payments from customers to Netherlands-based Uber BV. Most of it was converted back to Indian currency when payments were routed to cab drivers  accounts in India, after adjusting for commissions, promotions, etc. But the RBI agreed with local competitors like Meru that such transactions violated rules meant to prevent fraud or flight of capital from the country, and that foreign players could not be allowed to bypass a two-stage credit card authentication process required for digital payments in India. Uber was initially given until October 31 to fall in line with these requirements, but the deadline was extended to the end of November. Now Uber has added Paytm s digital wallet to its payment options. India is the first country where it has made such an arrangement. Those who have already registered with Paytm can just link their accounts with Uber. Others will need to sign up with Paytm which involves regulatory steps like verification of a phone number and email address.
