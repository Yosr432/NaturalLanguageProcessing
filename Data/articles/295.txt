Why Google, Microsoft and Amazon Love the Sound of Your Voice: Not so long ago, voice recognition was comically rudimentary. An early version of Microsoft's technology running in Windows transcribed "mom" as "aunt" during a 2006 demo before an auditorium of analysts and investors.Speech recognition must get much better if we are to speak naturally to our gadgets. So the tech industry is vacuuming up all the conversations it can.So Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and China's Baidu have embarked on a world-wide hunt for terabytes of human speech. Microsoft has set up mock apartments in cities around the globe to record volunteers speaking in a home setting. Every hour, Amazon uploads Alexa queries to a vast digital warehouse. Baidu is busily collecting every dialect in China. Then they take all that data and use it to teach their computers how to parse, understand and respond to commands and queries.  The challenge is finding a way to capture natural, real-world conversations. Even 95 percent accuracy isn't enough, says Adam Coates, who runs Baidu's artificial intelligence lab in Sunnyvale, California. "Our goal is to push the error rate down to 1 percent," he says.  "That's where you can really trust the device to understand what you're saying, and that will be transformative."
