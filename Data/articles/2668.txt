An interesting linguistic analysis of online reviews: In general, the length of a review corresponded with an item s price. The most frequent interjections were  wow,   yeah,   yuck,   yikes,   sheesh,   yum  and  yippee.  Slang terms that showed up most often were  meh,   whatever  and  the bomb.  And adjectives were not always what they seemed. Wherever it appeared, the word  delicious  was always unambiguously positive, but not so with  good.  On all five sites,  good  often appeared very close to the words  but  and  not,  indicating ambivalence. Reviewers often wrote statements like  It s good, but I m not in love with it,  or  It s good but not fall on the floor dance a jig good.  Among the most frequent three-word phrases, or three-grams, were  in the room  and  the front desk.  From these patterns, she surmised that consumers who stayed in hotels were about equally focused on the room s quality as they were on customer service. Frequent four-grams included  in the middle of,   the rest of the  and  at the end of.  That fits with Dr. V squez s observation that when people write about hotels, recipes or diaper bags, they like to tell stories. Narratives, she found, are more likely to appear in negative reviews than in positive ones.
