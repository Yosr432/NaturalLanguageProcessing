Rise, Fall, Redemption in Alibaba s Two Years Since IPO:  Two years ago this month, the listing of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. set off a 36 percent surge that lifted the Chinese Internet company past Facebook Inc. by market value. The gains didn t last and the stock went on to tumble through 2015 as sales growth slowed along with China s economy. Revenue growth has accelerated this year, and so too have the shares, sending Alibaba ahead of Tencent Holdings by value.
