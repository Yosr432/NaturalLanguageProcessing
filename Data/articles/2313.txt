Circle of Life - LivingSocial spawns a new generation of startups even as it shrinks: The tendency for start-ups to give rise to other start-ups is a self-sustaining cycle that excites technology enthusiasts. It can create a concentration of companies that generate well-paying jobs and attract skilled workers, as well as give well-heeled financiers a reason to invest money in the region. Nowhere is this more evident than Silicon Valley, where high-growth technology companies spin off new ventures, recycle engineering talent and grab billions of dollars from the world s biggest venture capitalists. It s the kind of ecosystem, built over decades, that other locales now strive to emulate. LivingSocial s ability to spawn a next generation of companies may be among its most significant contributions to the local economy, especially as its own promise to become one of the region s banner tech companies has faded. After raising hundreds of millions of dollars from investors to expand globally, LivingSocial in recent years has shrunk from 4,000 to 1,300 employees worldwide and retreated from countries in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.
