Apple Watch Sales Fall 55% in Second Quarter, IDC Report Says: Apple Watch sales fell 55 percent in the second quarter of 2016, dragging the global market for such devices lower, as potential customers hold off for an update coming later this year, according to a report from market intelligence firm IDC. Apple Inc. sold 1.6 million watches in the second quarter of this year, down from 3.6 million units a year earlier, IDC said. Global smartwatch sales fell 32 percent to 3.5 million units. While Apple held on to its position as the industry leader, with 47 percent of the market, it was the only company in the top five to see a decline. Samsung Electronics Co. saw its market share more than double to 16 percent. Consumers have held off on smartwatch purchases since early 2016 in anticipation of a hardware refresh, and improvements in WatchOS are not expected until later this year, effectively stalling existing Apple Watch sales," IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani wrote in the report.  Apple still maintains a significant lead in the market and unfortunately a decline for Apple leads to a decline in the entire market.
