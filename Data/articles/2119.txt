Urban Ladder aims for $100M in GMV, outlines tech-product plans: The firm has just raised $50 million in a fresh round of funding from both new and existing investors. The main focus is to expand our products and services to more cities, which we have been doing for the last six-seven months. The next focus is technology we are focusing on innovations in customer experience, mobility, automation and analytics. We are trying to offer a new customer experience, helping customers get a sense of our products. We believe a lot of innovation needs to happen in this space. Mobility is getting a big push. Customers are doing a lot of discovery, exploration and transactions via mobile. Once we have the right products, services and technology in place, we would want to enable a marriage of these aspects to bring out greater results. Our aim is to invite the customer to give us the key to his/her house so that we can design and furnish an extremely beautiful house and give the key back to the customer in just three weeks through a tech-enabled process. A lot of innovation needs to happen on the customer experience and the web (store) part. We are investing a lot on mobile technologies to provide a great experience on the core catalogue as well as on areas like visualisation, personalisation and app development. A bunch of innovations will come out on how customers interact with products on mobile and how customers engage with the brand on mobile. We are building a strong technology, user experience and product management team to look into these aspects. We are also looking at technologies such as ERP, GPS and RFID to automate and ensure smooth flow of information throughout the process without any manual involvement. Analytics is another key area of focus in terms of real-time data and dashboards. We now have a scale of data with which we will be able to gain a lot of inputs on buying patterns and personalisation can be done much more effectively with real-time analytics.
