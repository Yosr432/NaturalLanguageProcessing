Amazon quietly launched Echo, a voice-controlled smartspeaker with integrated voice-ordering from Amazon: Initial reactions are mixed at best:  Echo is priced at $199, Amazon said on its website today. Members of Amazon s Prime fast-shipping program can purchase the gadget for $99 for a limited period. With Echo, Amazon can plant a voice-activated device in homes that lets users easily order things from the Web retailer by adding it to their shopping lists via voice command and later confirming the purchase through a companion app. Yet it s unclear if consumers will see enough benefits and convenience to embrace another piece of hardware.  It seems like an odd and not-very-useful product,  said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The consumer doesn t need yet another device in their home that replicates what they already have on their phone.  Amazon introduced Echo with little fanfare, simply putting up a Web page about the device.
