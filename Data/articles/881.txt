Snapchat Raises $175 Million From Fidelity at Flat $16 Billion Valuation: Snapchat has raised $175 million in new venture funding from Fidelity at the same $16 billion valuation it raised at back in May, according to a source familiar with the deal. That means Snapchat has now raised around $1.4 billion in total. The Wall Street Journalfirst reported the new funding. A flat valuation isn t usually a great sign, but the raise comes at a time when lots of tech companies   including Jawbone and Foursquare   are raising down rounds, or taking money at a lower valuation than their last fundraising. In that vein, this investment doesn t look bad.
