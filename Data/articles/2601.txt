Credit derivatives traders helping RadioShack stay alive: RadioShack is finding an unlikely ally in its efforts to stay out of bankruptcy: credit derivatives traders who amassed more than $25 billion of trades speculating how much longer it can keep paying its bills. When the retailer s biggest shareholder arranged $585 million of funding in October to help it survive the holidays, much of the money came from hedge funds wagering on the company to avoid default, said people with knowledge of the trading. By injecting the 93-year-old electronics retailer with new money, swaps traders, more often blamed for pushing companies toward bankruptcy, have been preserving big payoffs if they can delay or prevent a default.  The sellers of the protection built up quite a large war chest, and it took a relatively small amount of money to keep the company going,  said Peter Tchir, a former credit-swaps trader who is now head of macro strategy at Brean Capital LLC in New York.  They have huge incentives to keep the company alive to not trigger the swaps.
