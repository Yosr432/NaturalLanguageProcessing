Apple Drops to Fifth in China s Mobile Market as Locals Rise: Apple Inc. dropped to fifth place in Chinese smartphone shipments, losing ground in its biggest overseas market in a fresh blow for the technology giant. IPhones made up 10.8 percent of devices sold in May, down from 12 percent a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. By comparison, Chinese vendor Huawei Technologies Co. increased its lead with 17.3 percent. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has publicly touted the importance of China, where the company is combating a slowing domestic economy and local vendors with increasingly popular devices. The launch of the cheaper iPhone SE was meant to boost Apple s popularity in developing markets and Cook met with China s vice premier Liu Yandong in May. Instead, it has suffered commercial, legal and regulatory setbacks in recent months leading to lawsuits and key products getting shut down. Local brands Huawei, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi are now the top four smartphone makers in China with a combined market share of 53 percent, according to Counterpoint research director Neil Shah. Oppo almost doubled its market share to 11 percent. Apple s sales in Greater China, which also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, fell 26 percent during the March quarter compared to a year earlier, amid a slowing market.
