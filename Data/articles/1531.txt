Dropbox s Wall Street Challenge: Dropbox boasts a valuation in the $10 billion range. Last February the company hired a new CFO, which for many startups is a signal that their IPO moment is coming sooner rather than later. Nobody knows for sure of course, and Dropbox isn t talking, but if the company does decide to move forward with a flotation, it could face several challenges in spite of its strong market presence. Dropbox could still have trouble persuading a doubtful Wall Street money machine, which has shown little love for cloud companies, that it can overcome several hurdles: For starters, it will need to convince them that the subscription business model with a different reporting methodology is viable. It must defend its hybrid consumer/enterprise approach   and perhaps face questions where it will concentrate its resources moving forward. Finally, the company with its core business in storage and file syncing has to find a way to overcome the commoditization of these services and the race to the bottom with some of the biggest names in the business.
