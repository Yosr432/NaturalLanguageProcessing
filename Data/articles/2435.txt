Apple Pay is  doing exceptionally well,  Steve Weinstein, an analyst at ITG Investment Research Inc., said in an interview before the earnings.  Once somebody uses it, it becomes a little over 5 percent of transactions that they were doing. It s a lot. It s really surprising, because you can t even use Apple Pay in that many locations.  Twenty percent to 30 percent of people who buy the new iPhones activate Apple Pay, Weinstein said. A smaller percentage uses the service regularly.  It seems that Apple Pay was a motivating factor for people buying the iPhone,  Nick Holland, an analyst at financial-services consultant Javelin Strategy & Research, said in an interview. A  double-digit  percentage of about 2,000 consumers Javelin surveyed last year after the service debuted said Apple Pay was part of the reason for their decision to buy a new Apple device.
