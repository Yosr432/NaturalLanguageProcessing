Tinder is starting to monetize - The Gap just ran a guerilla campaign on the app, its first. When you're flipping through Tinder looking for a Valentine's date, you might run into The Gap, too. The clothing company is launching a new ad campaign on the hot dating app, it said today. The Tinder ads are one part of The Gap's new campaign ahead of its spring line, which includes a new micro-series filmed for Instagram starring Jenny Slate and Paul Dano. "We did a little something special on Tinder," said Tricia Nichols, The Gap's leader of consumer engagement and brand strategies. "It's a guerrilla [marketing] idea where you'll see a profile with clever messaging in the spirit of love and the perfect match. It's the perfect fit for Tinder." It's also an unusual fit for Tinder. Until now, the dating app has not had many ad campaigns, especially from fashion brands. However, owned by IAC/InterActive, Tinder is looking for sources of revenue, offering a new premium ad-free option and running ads on the free service. This is the Gap's first ad on the app, and the retailer declined to reveal how much the placement cost.
