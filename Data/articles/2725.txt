An app to measure kids shoe size is a hit with moms: Stride Rite today is launching an iPad app to grab a chunk of that business, and it lets parents measure their children's feet size so they can then order shoes from the company. It is designed to alleviate a pain point for moms and dads who would rather not head to a store every few months to measure the shoe sizes for kids with constantly growing feet. Kristin Smith, director of e-commerce for the Boston-based retailer, said her brand has seen a 129 percent uptick in mobile traffic and a 200 percent jump in sales during the last 18 months. The app, called Rite Feet and developed by MJD Interactive, will be pushed with digital and social ads, as well as placements via Stride Ride's email list and 300 store locations. "We've seen a shift among millennial moms to mobile," Smith explained. "So we are building comprehesive strategy, beginning with the apps. And we are starting to look at iBeacons, though when it comes to mobile payments we're not quite there yet."
