IBM says SEC investigating company's books, shares fall: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how the International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) recognized revenue for certain deals in the United States, Britain and Ireland, IBM said on Tuesday, news that sent its shares down 4 percent. Shares of IBM fell as much as 4.4 percent to a five-year low of $137.33 and closed down 4 percent. News of the SEC probe came a week after the company posted lackluster quarterly results and cut its 2015 profit forecast. "It couldn't come at a worse possible time because now the stock is at another 52-week low as a result of this," said Belpointe analyst David Nelson. He said, however, that the probe "doesn't look like a massive smoking gun." "The investigation could be into warranty reserves, they could have recognized an item at the wrong time," Nelson said.
