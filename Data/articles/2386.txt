Twitters's slowing user engagement is posing existential questions though: Here s Twitter s Slowing User Growth In One Chart: The company added a mere 4 million new monthly active users in the quarter, which is an adjustment that it will likely explain on its earnings call. That 4 million figure bumped Twitter s monthly active user tally up from 284 million in its third quarter, to 288 million in the fourth. Up 20 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, it was a gain of just 1.4 percent on a sequential-quarter basis. Here s the carnage: Twitter is still growing, but that final figure is dangerously close to zero. And if Twitter actually stops growing, even for a quarter, and shrinks, expect investors to release holy hell all over the company s management team.
