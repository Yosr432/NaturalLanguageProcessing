US carrier Sprint bows to net neutrality, saying it won t throttle data anymore: To make sure it stays on the right side of net neutrality, Sprint will no longer slow down its customers' mobile data when its cell sites are congested, the company says. The decision is an early sign that the federal government's new rules for Internet providers are having an effect. Sprint's policy, which it said lasted for less than a year, was to slow down mobile data temporarily for data hogs in a congested area. The throttling affected the heaviest 5 percent of data users covered by a given cell site, and when the congestion eased, the restrictions were lifted.
