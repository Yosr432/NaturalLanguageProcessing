Intel's margins are being buoyed by rising prices for custom chips for cloud computing: Companies like A.W.S.  are running a million servers, so floor space, power, cooling, people   you want to optimize everything,  Ms. Bryant said.  The name of the game is customization.  Indeed. Amazon has gone so far as to change around the 50 megawatt power substations that power its bunkers of computers. Deep in Google, former company executives say, the company has changed the way Internet packets of data work, to optimize how quickly they flow through Google. Facebook, which has by far the world s largest public repository of pictures, might want a certain number of chips that can render images well, or rapidly process the steps for image recognition. That could affect the number of processing cores it wants on a chip. When eBay installed a hyper-efficient cooling system, it asked Intel for chips that had a greater thermal tolerance (they can be worked harder that way.) The difference appears to be showing up in Intel s results. While most of Intel s chips still go into PCs, about one-quarter of Intel s revenue, and a much bigger share of its profits, come from semiconductors for data centers. In the first nine months of 2014, the average selling price of PC chips fell 4 percent. But the average price on data center chips was up 10 percent, compared with the same period in 2013.
