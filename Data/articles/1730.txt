ClipMine Improves Videos With Crowdsourced Tagging And Annotations: So this happens to me pretty often: I pull up an online video that I want to watch, only to be taken aback when I realize that it s 10 or 20 or 30 minutes long. It s particularly frustrating when there s just one section or just one quote that I m looking for. I end up skipping around trying to find that one bit   not exactly a great experience. A new startup is trying to fix that. With ClipMine, you get searchable videos, with a table of contents. For example, here s a curated collection of videos related to startups. With each video, not only can you see an outline of all the big topics covered and jump to the section that interests you, you can also search for every time something gets mentioned (though your success will depend on how thoroughly the video has been tagged and annotated). To be clear, ClipMine isn t trying to build its own video player. Instead, it sits on top of players like YouTube. You can also install a plugin to see the ClipMine player anywhere you see YouTube videos.
