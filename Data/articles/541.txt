Good VR is great   and bad VR is abysmal: VR is a powerful medium, but difficult to work with   because the developer is put in the position of creating a sense of self and presence, more is required of them, and while successes are almost impossible to describe properly, failures are conspicuous and easily dissected. It s easiest to illustrate with actual examples. Easily the most interesting VR experience I ve had at E3 (of a dozen or so) was an Oculus demo called  The Climb,  by a team at Crytek. Using the Touch controllers (a new innovation; previously a gamepad was used), you manipulate a pair of disembodied hands, gripping ridges and cracks to make your way up a cliff face. Like many VR games, it sounds rather  boring. In fact, it s genius, but only within VR   and like so many other games, the only way to find that out is to play it. Nevertheless, It s excellent for several reasons, and these act as sort of guidelines for content that fits VR s strengths and avoid its weaknesses. Alas, I was disappointed by  Final Fantasy XV: The VR Experience,  despite being hyped for the game itself. Here, I found, was the worst possible outcome: a game that should and could be interesting, but does almost nothing right. Unlike  The Climb,  it sounds like a blast on paper. You and the other main characters from the game are in a battle with a Behemoth, one of the game s most well-known monsters. You re Prompto, the one who has a gun, supporting your buddies as they fight hand to hand. What it amounts to, however, and I m heartily sorry to say it, is a disjointed and boring five minutes that may leave you less excited for the game than when you donned the headset.
