Diverging Internet Usage Patterns: Facebook, Instagram Rule in the US, Messaging Apps Score Elsewhere: Messaging apps are becoming the most heavily-used type of app in a majority of key markets worldwide, based on both smartphone sessions and time spent in apps. However, according to new data from App Annie, the U.S. is an exception to that trend. Here, Facebook still dominates in terms of smartphone sessions, while both Facebook and Instagram led by time spent in apps. The data collected was based on Android sessions in the first quarter of this year, so it s not necessarily a full picture of the mobile application ecosystem or app usage   but it is sourced from one of the industry s largest datasets on mobile data. In fact, App Annie s dataset recently grew following its acquisition of  mobile measurement firm Mobidia last week. The firm is able to now detail app usage data from millions of users across 60 countries. With Mobidia and App Annie s data combined, the company put out its first-ever report examining usage-level trends regarding mobile applications, which looked, in particular, at countries like the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Not surprisingly, given that smartphones are primarily communication devices, the report found that within every key market, apps in the Communication and Social categories accounted for at least 40% of smartphone sessions on Android. And that trend was similar to how users spent time in apps, says App Annie. In the U.S., Social remained the top category based on sessions per active user, thanks to Facebook s prominent position here. But in the U.K., Germany, Japan, and South Korea, Communication was in the #1 position, referring to their preference for messaging apps.
