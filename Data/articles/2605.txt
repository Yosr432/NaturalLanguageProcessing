How smartphones maybe reducing Amazon's edge: Phones have already radically altered both the way Americans shop and how retail goods move about the economy, but the transformation is just beginning   and it is far from guaranteed that Amazon will emerge victorious from the transition. Phones are at the heart of the service offered by Postmates, one of several start-ups that are working with retailers and helping to change shopping experiences. As local retailers adopt mobile innovations, customers will be able to search stores  inventories, purchase goods for same-day delivery, and navigate and search for help and reviews inside a crowded store. None of these technologies pose an existential threat to Amazon, but by giving physical stores some of the conveniences that Amazon has long had, they may limit its potential reach. With Instacart, you can get groceries delivered instantly from big and small supermarkets. With Google s Express delivery service, you can get household goods from big-box stores delivered on the same day you order. The app Curbside lets users order items from Target, and have them ready when they drive up to a store. And with Postmates, it is possible to order takeout, and pretty much anything else, and have it delivered directly very quickly. These services all have in common speed and convenience: Because they route purchases from stores, they can often shuttle goods to buyers faster than they are available from Amazon. The prices are even competitive with Amazon, which delivers most of its products, even groceries, from warehouses that are a few hours away.
