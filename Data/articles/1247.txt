People doing  crazy things  with Tesla s autopilot are spoiling it for everybody: Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is warning that some new limits may be coming to the company's autopilot feature because of "some fairly crazy videos on YouTube" showing drivers behaving dangerously while the car is in control. Tesla doesn't recommend taking your hands off the wheel while the car is in autopilot mode. Yet that's exactly what some people are doing, leading to things like near-misses with other vehicles:Even the New York Times' video review made a big deal out of being able to drive hands-free. "This is not good," Musk said on an earnings call this week. "We'll put on some constraints on autopilot to minimize people doing crazy things with it." Musk didn't elaborate on what kinds of new restrictions autopilot users could soon face, though it's likely that they would show up in the form of another software update.
