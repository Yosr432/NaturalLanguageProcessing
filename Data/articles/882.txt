Facebook Messenger adds music, starting with Spotify song sharing: First came the Transportation hub with Uber, and now Facebook Messenger is launching  its very first music integration  with Spotify. Inside the Messenger  More  section in chat threads, all iOS and Android users will now find a Spotify option. Tap it and they ll be shuttled into Spotify s app where they can  Search for something to share.  Once they select a song, artist or playlist, they ll be popped back to Messenger with the option to share the photo of the cover artwork. When a friend taps that photo, they ll be bounced over to Spotify to listen.If Messenger can become a richer social layer connecting Spotify users, it could inspire deep conversations about music, boosting its engagement. That generates platform lock-in and potential monetization opportunities for Facebook. And for Spotify, Messenger will provide virality that could help it fend off Apple Music and convince more non-streamers of its value.
