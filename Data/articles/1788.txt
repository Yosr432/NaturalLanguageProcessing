Driven by smart acquisitions, Facebook stock at all-time high; Company valued at ~$250 billion : Facebook set an all-time high today, closing at $88.86 per share, valuing the company at just under $250 billion. However, what s most interesting in the Facebook bump isn t the simple fact that it is now worth more   shares and markets gyrate. Instead, it s the reasons why analysts are more bullish that are notable: Piper cited the Oculus Rift headset as a coming revenue source, while RBC gave the top line potential of Instagram as key to Facebook s value. Translating those points slightly, it seems that investors are taking into account the revenue side of Facebook s past purchases, and are adjusting their expectations higher as those acquisitions mature into income streams. That concept underscores how well the social company has done its recent acquisitions.
