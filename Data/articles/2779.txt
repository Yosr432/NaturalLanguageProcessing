Apple Pay Insight#1: It could substantially simplify in-app purchases - potentially be a huge win for Apple (via the App Store revenues) and for Facebook (which dominates in-app ad sales) but a bummer for Google (whose Play Store business is growing increasingly important as ad revenue growth slows). Although many people only associate Apple Pay with the ability to pay at point-of-sale at a growing number of supported retailers, Apple Pay also enables in-app transactions to take place with just a touch of the finger. That means that more consumers will be able to purchase things in apps, and this will be easier than before because they ll no longer have to remember their Apple ID and password. Instead, just by touching on the fingerprint reader on new iPhones and iPads running iOS 8, they ll be able to pay using the credit or debit card information on file, already associated with their Apple account. (Apple already offers Touch ID for in-app purchases, but Apple Pay could enable even more types of transactions to occur easily   like ordering food or ordering an Uber, for example)
