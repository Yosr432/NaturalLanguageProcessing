Indian cab-hailing firm Ola is raising $500 million+, at a valuation that we ve heard is around the $5 billion mark, with $225 million committed so far. The news comes as the company   which competes in its home market against the likes of Uber and Indian startup Meru   continues to expand into more cities, and more products. Today, Ola launched a new car leasing service for drivers on its network; last week it expanded to shuttle services for commuters. The raise is due to be finalised in the next week or two and announced officially then, sources tell TechCrunch. As it is still in progress, the final amount and final valuation may also change. This funding, a Series F, has been rumored for some time now, with the first reports surfacing just after Ola announced its last raise of $400 million in April of this year. That round, a Series E, valued the company at $2.5 billion.
