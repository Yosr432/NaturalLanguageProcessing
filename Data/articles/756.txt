China's $6 Billion Tech Funding Boom Signals Flight to Quality: If the startup funding party is finally breaking up, somebody forgot to tell China. The second-largest economy is avoiding the pitfalls affecting venture capital elsewhere, as investors around the world rein things in after an unprecedented technology financing boom. Ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. s finance affiliate and online property service Homelink are close to raising at least $6 billion, people familiar with the separate deals say. The operator of Alipay, Alibaba s affiliate, is targeting more than $3.5 billion alone, which would mark the technology industry s largest single round of financing. All those numbers emerged over the space of just three days last week. In China, larger startups like them are attracting major backers and garnering the lion s share of the money even as smaller operators are left to struggle. The frenetic pace is remarkable at a time venture investment globally is plateauing: there were fewer U.S. deals in the first three months than at any time in the past four years, according to research firm PitchBook Data.  China s VC market is becoming very polarized," said Jarod Ji, an analyst at Beijing-based research firm Zero2IPO.  There s not a lack of money in the market, but investors do feel that there s a lack of good projects and that s why companies like Didi are getting so much money.  The top 20 percent of Chinese startups could get 80 percent of the funding, he added.
