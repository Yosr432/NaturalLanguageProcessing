Alphabet s Legal Chief Steps Down From Uber Board: David Drummond, the chief legal officer at Alphabet Inc., has stepped down from Uber Technologies Inc. s board of directors as the two companies move further into each other s territories. Drummond joined the board in 2013 when GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet formerly known as Google Ventures, led a $258 million round of financing for Uber. It remains GV s largest investment, and the two companies worked together on projects, including the ability to call a car through Google Maps. However, relations between Alphabet s Google unit and Uber have become strained in recent years. Bloomberg reported last year that Google had been working on a ride-hailing service using self-driving cars. Uber acquired Otto, an autonomous driving startup staffed by former Google employees, and is working with Volvo on driverless vehicles of its own, which the companies expect to begin rolling out in Pittsburgh this month. Uber has been developing its own mapping operation and is shooting street photography to create an alternative to Google s map data.
