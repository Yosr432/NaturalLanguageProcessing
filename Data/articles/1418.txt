Startups are piggybacking on text messaging to launch services. Conventional wisdom holds that intricately designed mobile apps are an essential part of most new consumer technology services. But there are signs people are getting apped out. While the amount of time U.S. smartphone users spend with apps continues to increase, the number of apps the average person uses has stayed pretty much flat for the last two years, according to a report Nielsen published in June. Some 200 apps account for more than 70 percent of total usage. Product Hunt, a popular website where people post ideas for new tech services, recently compiled a list of more than 40  apps without an interface,  most of which use text messaging to do things like schedule meetings, sell T-shirts, or process restaurant delivery orders. In August, Facebook introduced M, a digital personal assistant built into its messaging service that allows people to text requests for a dinner reservation or for the perfect baby gift. The service, which is being tested by a small number of users in California, hints at Facebook s ambitions to transform its own messaging app into a kind of proprietary Internet where people spend all their time instead of bouncing around among different apps. The social media giant appears to be emulating China s WeChat, which has embedded a broad range of services into its mobile messaging product. The simplicity of text-based services often obscures deep complexity. Most companies still struggle with what s known as natural language processing, so what may appear to be impressive feats of automation are actually being done by old-fashioned humans. Facebook s M service uses artificial intelligence to field requests, but people perform the actual tasks. Magic, a text-based concierge service that inspired excitement in startup circles when it was introduced earlier this year, does the same.
