PayPal to Acquire Xoom for $890 Million Ahead of EBay Split: PayPal agreed to purchase Xoom Corp, a service for sending international money transfers, in a deal valued at $890 million. PayPal will acquire Xoom for $25 per share in cash, a 21 percent premium to Wednesday s closing price. The purchase is expected to slightly reduce PayPal s earnings per share for fiscal 2016, the company said. The acquisition puts PayPal in the international money transfer market with Western Union, the dominant player in what PayPal President Dan Schulman estimated is a $600 billion market.  It s an industry that s ripe for disruption,  Schulman, who will become chief executive officer of the stand-alone PayPal, said in an interview. Xoom, based in San Francisco, enables U.S. customers to send as much as $3,000 in a single transaction to friends and family around the world using their mobile phones, tablets or computers. Its 1.3 million users transferred $7 billion to 37 countries, including Mexico, China and India, in the 12 months ended March 31, the company said. Xoom s first-quarter revenue gained 24 percent to $44.4 million.
