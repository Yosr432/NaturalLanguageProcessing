The NBA is streaming a game live to Facebook for the first time   but only in India: The NBA will livestream a regular season basketball game directly to Facebook for the first time on Sunday, but there s a catch: The game, a matchup between the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings, will only be available to Facebook users in India. The livestream is tied to an in-stadium promotion from the Sacramento Kings   Sunday at the arena is Bollywood Night. (Kings owner Vivek Ranadive also grew up in India.) Facebook users in India won t need to pay to watch the game, and will see the local Kings and Warriors broadcasts that are usually available as part of the NBA s International League Pass subscription, according to a league spokesperson. The stream won t include commercials, so viewers will see the in-stadium entertainment during stoppages in play. It s unknown if Facebook paid the NBA to stream the game. A League spokesperson declined to comment on financial terms of the deal, and Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NBA already streams a lot of content on both Facebook and Twitter, but has never livestreamed an actual NBA game on those platforms. Those games are valuable, and broadcasters like Turner and ESPN pay billions of dollars for the rights to stream them weekly in the U.S.
