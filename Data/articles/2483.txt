Palantir raised money at $15B recently, and is looking for more: Palantir Technologies Inc. raised money at a $15 billion valuation late last year and is now looking for more funding, according to people with knowledge of the situation, as the data-analysis software startup seeks to expand its business. Palantir raised the money in late 2014 because investors were eager to invest, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. The round totaled $500 million and was completed in November, said another person, who added that Palantir is currently raising even more financing. A Palantir representative declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Palantir s $15 billion valuation and current funding plans. The new valuation is up from the $9 billion that Palantir was valued at in late 2013 and underscores the soaring values of startups across Silicon Valley. Uber Technologies Inc., a San Francisco-based mobile car-booking company, reeled in two financings exceeding $1 billion each last year and was valued at $40 billion last month. Investors have been pumping money into U.S. startups, to the tune of $48.3 billion last year, the most since 2000, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Palantir got its start building software that helped tie disparate databases together to make it easier to search and analyze information. The technology was a hit among police agencies and intelligence services that wanted to illuminate patterns of behavior among individuals and manage large volumes of data more efficiently. Wall Street firms have since emerged as Palantir s biggest customers, using the company s software to detect fraud and evaluate loans, among other things. Last March, hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP hired Palantir to boost surveillance.
