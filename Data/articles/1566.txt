Apple might be bringing fighter-jet technology to car windshields: The world s most valuable company is  very likely  working on a 27- to 50-inch head-up display, a technology most famously used by jet pilots, that could project vivid icons and information for drivers while on the road, a tech analyst with Global Equities Research said Thursday morning. The curved-glass screen could also be wired with sensors and  may be completely gesture-controlled,  a stealth project that analyst Trip Chowdhry said could be Apple s  next generation  device, after gadgets such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Rumors about Apple s secret innovations have become a regular pastime for the many tea-leaf readers of Silicon Valley, and Chowdhry, who seems to be the only analyst so far to suggest Apple is working on a HUD, has been wrong before. But if Apple s head-up display really is in the works, it could mark a huge leap for the $660 billion gorilla into an industry already packed with big-money carmakers and tech firms, and further embolden the idea that Apple is looking to stake new territory on the world s roads. Apple s hiring of auto-industry specialists and sightings in California of Apple-leased camera-mounted vans have fueled rumors that the software-hardware company is looking to build its own kind of car. In February, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal said that hundreds of Apple employees were working on a self-driving minivan, code-named Project Titan.
