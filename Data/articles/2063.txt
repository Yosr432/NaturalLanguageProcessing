GE is installing sensors into L.E.D streetlights so that city can collect data: Earlier this month, General Electric announced it was selling GE Capital, its financial arm. With less fanfare, G.E. also unveiled plans for computer-connected L.E.D. streetlights, so cities can collect and analyze performance data, for lower costs and better safety. GE Capital was a huge profit center after the financial deregulation of the 1980s, but that was then. Sensor-rich lights, to be found eventually in offices and homes, are for a company that will sell knowledge of behavior as much as physical objects.  The next generation of bulbs have a life cycle of 20 years; we can t think of that as a transactional business anymore,  said Bill Ruh, the head of G.E. s software center.  We can put cameras and more sensors on these, and measure motion, heat, air quality.  Retailers might want such lights to steer shoppers, he said, while consumers could better learn about their electricity consumption. This sensor explosion is only starting: Huawei, a Chinese maker of computing and communications equipment with $47 billion in revenue, estimates that by 2025 over 100 billion things, including smartphones, vehicles, appliances and industrial equipment, will be connected to cloud computing systems. The Internet will be almost fused with the physical world.
