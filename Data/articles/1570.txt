Strong U.S. sales help Cisco beat estimates: Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as strong demand for its products in the United States more than offset weakness elsewhere. Shares of Cisco, considered a bellwether for the performance of the broader network gear industry, rose nearly 4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. The company is the market leader in selling network equipment to businesses, controlling about half of the $38 billion global market and overshadowing rivals Hewlett-Packard and China's Huawei, according to market research firm Gartner. For the fourth quarter, the company earned 59 cents per share on an adjusted basis, while revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $12.84 billion. Cisco's latest results also underscore an ongoing recovery in sales of the company's switches and routers, which were hit by a slowdown in spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, in the second half of 2014. The company has also been investing in new products and services such as data analytics software, security and cloud-management tools. Cisco said in June it would buy cloud-based security firm OpenDNS for $635 million. The company also said revenue from telecom providers rose 2 percent in the quarter but added that it did not expect an increase in capital spending by its traditional customers.
