Zomato embeds Uber button to its own app for hailing cabs to reach restaurants in 13 countries: Zomato.com, owned and operated by Gurgaon-based Zomato Media Pvt Ltd, has entered into a partnership with Uber Technologies Inc (Uber) to enable users to book cabs to the restaurant they are planning to eat at, right from its own app. The feature has gone live for Zomato users in London and South Africa, and will now be rolled out to users in other key markets. The partnership would cover Zomato users in 27 cities across 13 countries where both the firms have a presence   India, Australia, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the US.  This partnership makes eating out more convenient with the Zomato app connecting to Uber services seamlessly,  said Pankaj Chaddah, co-founder and COO, Zomato.  Through this API integration, Zomato users in 13 countries will now be able to reach those hidden gems in their cities seamlessly and in style,  said Eric Alexander, head of business, Asia, Uber. How it works:Once a user has found a place to dine at or have drinks at using the Zomato app, a single tap on the Uber button on the restaurant page will allow him/her to find the nearest Uber cab. In addition to seeing the estimated fare and how long it will take for the Uber to arrive, one will also be able to choose the Uber service that best suits one s need.
