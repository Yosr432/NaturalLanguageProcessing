Facebook Starts Auto-Enhancing Photos on the same day that Instagram launches its first new filters since 2012: Rather than making you manually filter them, Facebook tells me it will now auto-enhance newly uploaded photos starting today on iOS and soon on Android. You ll be able to adjust a slider to control just how enhanced you want the light, shadow, and clarity, or revert back to your original shot. Facebook and the other social apps are locked in a battle for photo sharing. To the winner goes tons of engagement. That s why Twitter just revamped its filtering interface, Snapchat started letting you dual-filter with color filters and its geo-filter titles, and Instagram today added five new filters. Google+ added a similar auto-enhance feature a year ago. Photos are automatically enhanced, but you can quickly tone the effect up or down. I found the auto-enhancements to be a touch overzealous in some of my experiments, but it s typically in the ballpark of how I d want to edit a photo, plus it requires no work on my part.
