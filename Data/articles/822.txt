Apple s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption: Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage. Before the Silicon Valley giant unveiled modest upgrades to its device lineup, Timothy D. Cook, Apple s chief executive, defended the company s stance in its fight with the federal government over the encryption on iPhones. The case had been expected to head to a court hearing on Tuesday, but the Justice Department abruptly moved on Monday to cancel the hearing, saying it might not need Apple s help to break into the phone used by a gunman in last year s San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting. In a news conference at Apple s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast.  We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,  Mr. Cook said.  This is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.
