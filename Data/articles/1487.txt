Google will Penalize App-Install Ads in Search Rankings: Google is on a mission to clean up the mobile Web and make it comport to its vision of the world. In April, the search engine tweaked its search algorithm to favor sites it deemed  mobile-friendly    a shift the industry dubbed  mobilegeddon . Now Google is adding another metric for mobile friendliness: The absence of ads that take over a screen and push an app. Starting today, those ads will be included in the mobile test Google gives publishers. Then, starting Nov. 1, sites that carry those ads will be punished in search rankings. Daniel Bathgate, a Google search engineer, explained the rationale in a post:  Our analysis shows that it is not a good search experience and can be frustrating for users because they are expecting to see the content of the Web page.  For Google, the changes are geared specifically at search results, part of its ongoing effort to make querying on mobile better. The changes will only affect sites pushing app-install ads in search results, so they don t restrict the ads within apps. Also, the tweak won t hit full-screen blasts that promote other publisher treats, like email newsletters or the  Like us on Facebook  pages that digital publications such as Vice and Fusion use. Thus far, there s some evidence that Google s attempt to improve the quality of mobile websites has improved its ability to make money from them.
