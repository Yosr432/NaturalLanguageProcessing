Groupon Soars 23% On Favorable Earnings: Not dead yet, deal site Groupon soared 23% in initial after-hours trading, following a better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings release. The company beat revenue forecasts, bringing in $917 million, instead of the anticipated $846 million, and a 9% year-over-year increase.  Adjusted earnings per share was a four cents, whereas Wall Street was expecting zero. This is quite the bright spot for the company   until today, the stock had been down 71% in the past year. Shares closed Thursday at $2.24, a far cry from the $20 per share the company saw when it went public in November 2011. Groupon has expanded beyond its core local deal business, acquiring services like Ideel, for fashion discounts and OrderUp, for food delivery. But perhaps until now, nothing has been able to change investor perception that the Groupon brand is tarnished. At one point, the company held acquisition conversations with Google, around a $6 billion price tag.  Today, Groupon closed the day with a market cap of $1.4 billion.
