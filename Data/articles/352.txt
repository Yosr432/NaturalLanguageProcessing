Twitter is finally paying its best users to create videos: Twitter wants the kind of video creators YouTube has   and the massive audiences that come with them. To make this dream a reality, the company is pulling a page from YouTube s playbook: It s going to sell ads alongside creator videos and share that ad revenue with the people making the content. And Twitter is offering very appealing terms. Unlike YouTube, which gives 55 percent of the money to creators and keeps 45 percent, Twitter is using the same revenue split it already offers other Amplify video partners, like the NFL: 70 percent to the content creator and 30 percent back to Twitter, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. Of course, Twitter needs to offer an appealing revenue split like this. It s nowhere close to the video destination YouTube and even Facebook have become, and it s late to the game when it comes to paying creators. The network s high-profile stars have wanted a revenue split for some time   it s been a point of contention for the company s stable of  Vine stars,  many of whom have left for places like YouTube where their videos actually make money.
