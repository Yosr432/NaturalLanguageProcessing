EBay's disappointing forecast fuels stock decline: EBay forecast weaker-than-expected revenue and profit for the current quarter and full year, as the e-commerce company struggles against a strong dollar while trying to revamp its core marketplace business. Shares of the retailer fell more than 12 percent to $23.51 in extended trading on Wednesday. The online retailer, which faces intense competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com, has also been hit by brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart Stores that are aggressively boosting their online presence. The company said its gross merchandise value, or the total value of all goods sold on its site, rose 5 percent after accounting for foreign exchange impact. In its second quarter without PayPal, eBay's revenue was $2.32 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, flat with a year earlier during the crucial holiday shopping season and in line with analysts' average expectations. EBay began testing a paid shipping membership program in Germany last year, responding to shoppers' increased demand for faster delivery. Wenig on Wednesday said there were "no plans for now" to expand the program. EBay derives nearly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas and faces headwinds from a strong dollar.
