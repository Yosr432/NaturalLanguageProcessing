Line launches grocery delivery in Thailand, seeks to make jump to eCommerce from messaging as growth slows: (More coverage here) A month after introducing its own Uber-like service in Tokyo, Line   the Japanese messaging service known for its zany cartoon stickers   is taking a first step towards grocery sales and delivery in Southeast Asia, in the style of U.S. startup Instacart. Beginning in Thailand this week, where it claims 36 million registered users, Line will offer up a range of perishable and non-perishable goods via its messaging app. It is initially testing the concept using a daily deals model, which will include three daily deals and two  heavily discounted  offers per week, but there are plans to do more over time. The promotions will be publicized by three existing Line  brand  accounts that have showcased promotions for consumer products since last year   in other words, Line users deliberately opt in for the grocery deals, it isn t spam that is sent to all. The longer-term plan here is for Line to build out a fuller channel for food (and general) shopping across Southeast Asia. Finally, Line is promising free, next-day delivery for all purchases, although the company isn t handling this side of the project. aCommerce   a Bangkok-based startup that raised $10.7 million from Docomo and others last summer, and works with Line on other commerce ventures   will provide the logistics and fulfillment backbone. Line claims 92 million active users across Japan, Thailand and Taiwan, and it seems feasible that a mobile commerce play could work in these markets. But its most recent financial report showed new user growth is slowing, and half of its 181 million active users worldwide is located in those three aforementioned countries. That makes the potential adoption of regional and global services somewhat uncertain at this point.
