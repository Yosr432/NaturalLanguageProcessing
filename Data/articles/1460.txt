TiVo revenue beats estimates on subscriptions rise: Digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue, helped by higher subscriptions. The company's total subscriptions rose about 26 percent to more than 6 million in the second quarter ended July 31. Net revenue rose to $119.5 million from $111.9 million. Revenue from Tivo's services and software and technology businesses rose about 14 percent to $99.1 million, while analysts had expected $96 million.  The stock was flat in extended trading on Tuesday. TiVo's set-top boxes are in high demand from cable users as they also allow access to online video services such as Netflix Inc, Hulu and Google Inc's YouTube. Tivo sells subscriptions directly to customers with its video recorders and also licenses its technology to cable TV operators that rent recorders to subscribers. The company, whose clients include DirecTV, is trying to partner with more cable TV operators to grow its business. Tivo sells its products through cable TV partners such as Virgin Media in the UK, ONO in Spain and Com Hem AB in Sweden.
