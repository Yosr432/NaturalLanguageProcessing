Autodesk earnings: revenue $646M, +9.1% Y/Y;  shares fall 8% in extended trading. Autodesk  which makes computer-aided design software, forecast lower-than-expected profit and revenue for the second quarter, citing a stronger dollar. Autodesk, known for its AutoCAD software used by construction companies, engineers and manufacturers to design products and simulate real-world performance, now expects revenue growth of 2-4 percent for the year. The company had earlier forecast a 3-5 percent growth. Shares of the company, which also cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, fell nearly 8 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. Autodesk, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from outside the Americas, projected currency rate fluctuations to hit revenue growth by 5 percentage points for the year ending January 31. Revenue increased to 9.1 percent $646.5 million. The company, which is moving from a license-based business to a cloud-based subscription model, said subscription revenue rose 15.7 percent to $319.8 million. Subscriptions bring in less money upfront, as payment is spread over the entire period of use unlike traditional packaged software, but typically ensure more predictable recurring revenue. The switch to the new model increased Autodesk's costs. While total cost of revenue increased 16.6 percent, total operating expenses went up 13.1 percent. The company's net income fell to $19.1 million, or 8 cents per share, from $28.3 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.
