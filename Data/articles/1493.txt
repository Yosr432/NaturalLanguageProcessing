Google Launches Native Ads In Gmail To All Advertisers: Google is rolling out a new ad format in Gmail to all advertisers today. A few years ago, Google launched a new kind of native ad in Gmail that sat at the top of the inbox and mostly looked like a regular email. For the most part, that was a pretty unobtrusive way of displaying ads (though some people were rather annoyed by them). Starting today, Google is making it easier for all advertisers to buy these ads. Advertisers can now buy these new Gmail ads directly from AdWords. For Gmail users, these ads will work very differently from the type of ads Google first introduced for Gmail and they will appear both in the mobile versions of Gmail and on the web. The native ads are collapsed by default and will expand to full-page native ads when you click on them. Google says the idea here is to  recreate the informational and visual richness of a landing page.  It looks like Google will charge advertisers every time a user expands one of these ad units (and all subsequent clicks from there are then free). What s interesting is that these ads are made for forwarding, too, with a  forward  and  Save to Inbox  link underneath all of them. When you click on  Save to Inbox,  the ad will move into your inbox and you can then treat it just like any other regular email.
