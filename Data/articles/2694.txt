Asian shoppers lead the world in 'showrooming': Implication: location-based targeting which is red-hot in the US (news here and here) could be even hotter here: Asia s shoppers are experts at  showrooming    the phenomenon of looking at items at a brick-and-mortar store whilst simultaneously checking the prices available online. According to data from Google s Consumer Barometer survey (shown in a new post on Google s APAC blog), this showrooming is most prevalent in less developed tech markets, where you might expect it the least. The top showroomers are Vietnam s shoppers. 40 percent of them stand in a store whilst cross-checking the prices online. South Korea is second.
