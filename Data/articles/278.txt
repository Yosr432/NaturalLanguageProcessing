U.S. companies want to play China s game. They just can t win it. Netflix has a nifty new China strategy: Skip it. Facebook s China charm offensive, which included Mark Zuckerberg studying Mandarin, has yielded little. Google s search business and Twitter remain blocked. LinkedIn and Microsoft censor   and still, neither is a major player in China s online space. Amazon.com is sputtering along against the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. After great initial success, Apple is being overtaken by local upstarts. For some highflying U.S. Internet businesses, the China dream is fading; for others, it looks radically different from what they had hoped. California s Internet companies once dreamed of liberating China with technology, thinking that the system of censorship known as the Great Firewall would inevitably crumble like the Berlin Wall, paving the way for their advance in the world s most populous nation.

Six years after Google retreated from China s search-engine business over censorship and hacking concerns, U.S. firms seem more willing than ever to play the Communist Party s game   they just can t win it. Even if they can gain a foothold, which is hard enough, there is practically no way they will be able to overtake the Chinese companies that have comfortably established themselves.
