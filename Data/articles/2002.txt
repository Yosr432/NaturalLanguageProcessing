Pinterest Adds $186M To Series G Funding Round, Offers Secondary Sale To Employees Looking to Cash Out: Pinterest confirmed that it has padded its Series G funding a bit and is carrying out a new secondary sale that will allow employees to cash in some of their shares. As first reported by Re/code, the social sharing startup raised an additional $186 million in funding as part of its Series G round, bringing the total amount raised in that financing to $553 million. New investors in the round include Wellington Management Company and Goldman Sachs, while existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer, First Mark, SV Angel, Valiant, and Fidelity also participated.

This is the second time Pinterest has offered the option of a secondary sale to its employees, with the first being held in October 2012.
