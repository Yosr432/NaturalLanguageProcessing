Facebook s popularity among teens dips again, but Instagram is now worth $35B (35x in 2 years), sending Facebook stock to a record high: A report yesterday by Frank N. Magid Associates Inc. found that the portion of 13- to 17-year-old social-media users in the U.S. on Facebook slipped to 88 percent this year from 94 percent in 2013 and 95 percent in 2012. Facebook first warned a year ago that teens weren t using its website as often as before, then stopped discussing teen usage on its earnings calls after last year s disclosure alarmed investors. While more people use Facebook and its messaging app than any competitor, its user base tends to be older, with 55 percent of Facebook Messenger users being 37 or younger. By the same measure, 86 percent of Snapchat Inc. s users and 83 percent of Kik Interactive Inc. s users are under 37. Facebook sought to buy Snapchat last year for more than $3 billion, and was rebuffed. This has not prevented Facebook stock from reaching record highs: This year Facebook made further headway in mobile, a business that has flourished from a minor portion of ad revenue at the time of the IPO to a majority. Facebook s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion has also been paying off: A Citigroup Inc. analyst last week said the photo-sharing app is worth $35 billion.
