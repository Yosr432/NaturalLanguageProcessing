Alibaba, Ant Financial invest about $680 million in Paytm, up stake to 40%: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has made a strategic investment in One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, along with its affiliate Ant Financial, which had made its first investment in February 2015. With this, Alibaba becomes a new investor in the Indian online payment and e-commerce firm. Two people aware of the details told ET that the Alibaba Group Holding will pick up about 20% stake through a fresh issue of shares by investing about $680 million(around Rs4,450 crore). The deal has been closed. In February, Ant Financial had picked up a 25% stake for $575 million, of which $200 million came in as the first tranche. The fresh investment by Alibaba Group Holdings subsumes the outstanding tranche of $375 million, and will see Ant Financial's stake being lowered to 20%, one of the people aware of the details said.  Alibaba will now hold around 20%. With this, Alibaba will become the biggest shareholder in the company as it will hold 40% through two entities, and Paytm will be its ecommerce play in India. Under the financial contours of the transaction, existing investor Saif Partners' stake comes down to 30% from 37% while Paytm's founder and Chairman & Managing Director Vijay Shekhar Sharma now owns about 21%, down from 27%.
