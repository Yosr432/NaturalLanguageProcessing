SurveyMonkey raises $250M, valued at ~ $2B: SurveyMonkey, the Silicon Valley company that runs an online survey and questionnaire platform, announced today that it has raised $250 million in a new round of funding. The raise was first reported last night by the Wall Street Journal, and was officially confirmed by the company this morning. The new money will be used at least in part to fuel more M&A transactions, and to allow some existing investors and employees to cash out if they choose, SurveyMonkey said in a statement. This brings the total amount of venture capital invested into the 15-year-old company to more than $1.15 billion. The new round, which included participation from a group of institutional investors, reportedly values SurveyMonkey at some $2 billion, up significantly from the $1.35 billion valuation the company had just one year ago.
