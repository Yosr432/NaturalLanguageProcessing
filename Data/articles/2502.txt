Indian capital market regulator Sebi is working on crowdfunding guidelines: SEBI is is holding consultations for  evolving guidelines  on crowd funding that will help start ups raise funds. Crowd-funding typically involves young entrepreneurs and small groups of people raising funds for their ventures through various online platforms involving individuals as well as organisations. Sebi whole-time member Rajeev Agarwal today said the regulator  was evolving guidelines in consultation with government for funding arrangements for star up entrepreneurs . The market regulator had, in July last year, come out with draft norms on crowd funding. Under the proposed norms, the issuer entities and their promoters and directors would need to meet  fit and proper  criteria of Sebi, while they can not use multiple platforms to raise such funds within a year, among others. According to Sebi, there is a need for funding for SME through alternative sources as 2008 global financial crisis made it difficult for banks to lend money to the ventures or start-ups, which may have high risk element. However, Sebi said there is possibility of systemic risk associated with crowd-funding as well as chances that investors could be defrauded.
