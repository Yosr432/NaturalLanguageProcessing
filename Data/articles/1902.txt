The Chip Industry Consolidates - In The Third Big Chip Merger of the Year, Intel Agrees to Buy Altera for $16.7 Billion. Recent months have seen a flurry of deals in the semiconductor sector, a business that has become prohibitively expensive for all but the biggest players. On Monday, Intel, the world s largest maker of chips, said it would pay $16.7 billion for chip company Altera. Last week, Avago Technologies agreed to pay $37 billion for Broadcom. And in March, a company called NXP Semiconductors paid $11.8 billion for Freescale Semiconductor, which began life as part of Motorola and specializes in chips for sensors and cars.  Ten years ago the cost from designing a new chip to making it a product was $10 million to $50 million,  said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner.  Today it s $100 million to $200 million. Solving weird and challenging physics problems at this small size requires a lot of expensive equipment. That s why there s all this M.&A.  Besides gaining so-called economies of scale, Intel hopes Altera puts it in better shape for two of the biggest emerging markets, large data centers and the so-called Internet of Things, or computer-enriched machines that work with other devices. Altera s primary chips help Intel target that market. The San Jose, Calif., company s chips can be reprogrammed once they leave the foundry, altering some of their functions. Intel s semiconductors are more powerful, but lack that flexibility. By combining the two types on a single chip, Intel thinks that by late next year it can start offering its big business customers ways of fine-tuning performance to suit specific needs. Also, Intel has fallen behind another big chip company, Qualcomm, in the market for low-powered chips that run mobile devices even as sales of chips for personal computers have slowed. For Intel, improving what it can do in newer, growing sectors is essential. Shares of Altera closed Monday up 5.8 percent. Intel shares were down about 1.6 percent.
