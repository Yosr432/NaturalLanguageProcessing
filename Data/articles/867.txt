Lyft is catching up with Uber in New York City: Lyft is gaining momentum in a key market for the company and its more established competitor, Uber. According to figures the company provided to Re/code, Lyft has seen its driver pool grow by a factor of four and has seen six times the number of active weekly riders in New York since May 2015. In February of this year, Lyft drivers in New York performed six times the total number of rides they performed in May 2015, the company said. It s a clear indicator that New York riders and drivers have warmed up to the pink-mustachioed ride-hailing company despite Uber s first-mover advantage. The growth in riders is in part a result of the recent fare cuts Lyft implemented across 33 cities, including New York (following Uber s fare cuts in more than 80 cities), but it also follows the company s increased investment in its marketing efforts both in terms of staff as well as in promotions and ad buys.
