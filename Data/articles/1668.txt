A $7 Billion Charge at Microsoft Leads to Its Largest Loss Ever: An accounting charge wiped out Microsoft s profit for the quarter, leading to its largest loss ever, the company said on Tuesday, making clear the cost of its missteps in the mobile business. The $7.5 billion accounting charge, stemming from Microsoft s troubled acquisition of Nokia s cellphone business, was disclosed by the company earlier this month, along with plans to eliminate 7,800 jobs, mostly in the company s phone operations. While the accounting charge was on paper and will not diminish the company s huge cash hoard, it was a psychic blow to Microsoft, one of the biggest money makers in tech. Investors, however, seemed to mostly look beyond Microsoft s struggles in the phone market. They appeared to focus on two of the company s most important businesses, Windows and Office, which showed some signs of weakness. Those were somewhat offset by strong growth in its cloud services business, Xbox games and Surface tablets. For its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, Microsoft said its net loss was $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared with net income of $4.61 billion, or 55 cents a share, during the same period last year. While the company s stumbles in smartphones have shown the bruising downsides of the hardware business for Microsoft, it had success with other devices, including its Surface tablet, the revenue from which grew 117 percent, to $888 million. Revenue from its Xbox game business rose 27 percent. In total, Microsoft said it had nearly $2 billion in computing and gaming hardware revenue in the quarter. Revenue from Microsoft s overall commercial cloud business grew 88 percent during the quarter, one of the brightest spots in its results. Microsoft s shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading
