Indian startup action #2: Zomato enters US with purchase of Urbanspoon for around $40-50M, aims at Yelp: Zomato.com has struck its sixth overseas acquisition in as many months and its biggest yet by acquiring Urbanspoon, a restaurant information and table booking property, the company s co-founder and chief Deepinder Goyal said in a blog post. The transaction value stands undisclosed but is pegged at around $40-50 million. Goyal said in his blog post that the firm spent most of its last round of funding on this acquisition. In November, Zomato had raised $60 million in a fresh round of funding at a pre-money valuation of $600 million from existing investors Info Edge (India) and Sequoia while adding Vy Capital as a new investor. Urbanspoon, which was part of NASDAQ-listed umbrella firm for various internet ventures IAC, has a presence in six countries including US, Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia and New Zealand. It was a self funded venture before IAC snapped the firm in 2009. It has 80 million+ visit a month as against 35 million+ of Zomato; presence in over 500 cities as against 150 million+ for Zomato with over 1 million restaurant listings, over 1.4 million reviewers and around nine times the number of ratings compared to Zomato. The acquisition would make the first big move by an Indian internet venture in the US. Zomato s approach of hiring people to curate and constantly update restaurant listings and menus will present a challenge to Yelp and Foursquare, which rely more on user-generated reviews. This involves a lot of legwork but pays off for Zomato as users are less likely to encounter an outdated menu or a restaurant that has no resemblance to its review.
