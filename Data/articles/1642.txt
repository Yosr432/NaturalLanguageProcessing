In its next move, Amazon could turn to physical grocery stores: Amazon wants to set up drive-through grocery stores where consumers can pick up goods they've ordered online, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal. Where this could have the biggest impact is on perishables, which obviously require timely delivery. Although shoppers can already buy some perishables through Amazon Fresh and get them delivered the same day, the $300 annual membership isn't for everyone. And the logistics of delivering fresh groceries right to people's homes is still a big challenge. Amazon has reportedly explored retail locations before, but doing it just for groceries would be a different thing entirely.
