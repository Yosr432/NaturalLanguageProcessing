Tech start-ups the new gold for China's wealthy as economy slows: More wealthy Chinese are ploughing money into technology start-ups which are increasingly seen as a safe haven as the slowing economy eases hopes of extracting returns from traditional investment such as stocks, property or gold. While Chinese shares are being pummelled and the yuan is under pressure, these private investors are turning to businesses such as taxi-hailing company Didi Kuaidi, which saw its valuation rise 25 percent to about $20 billion in a $1 billion funding round launched last week. This gain sharply contrasts with the 43 percent plunge in the CSI 300 index of top-listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen since June last year, underscoring the appetite for tech firms. China's stock markets are the worst performing in the region, according to Thomson Reuters data. Even some mid-sized banks, including China Merchants Bank are investing into tech ventures. What is unique about China's venture capital and private equity industry is that a good chunk of yuan fund raising comes from wealthy individual investors. This contrasts with Western markets, where institutional investors take the lion's share of such placements. A lawyer told Reuters she had recently structured several investment deals into tech companies for wealthy clients. She declined to be named, or give details of the deals due to the confidentiality of the matter.
