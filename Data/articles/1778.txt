The Mouth Is Mightier Than the Pen: New research shows that text-based communications may make individuals sound less intelligent and employable than when the same information is communicated orally. The findings imply that old-fashioned phone conversations or in-person visits may be more effective when trying to impress a prospective employer or, perhaps, close a deal. In the first of a series of experiments presented in the paper, the researchers recruited 18 MBA. candidates from Booth. The students were asked to prepare a brief pitch to a prospective employer   a roughly two-minute proposal that the researchers recorded on video. Separately, the researchers recruited 162 people who were visiting the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to evaluate these pitches. Some of these museum-goers watched the video, a second group listened to the audio without watching the video, and a third group read a transcript of the pitch. What the researchers found was that the evaluators who heard the pitches   whether in the audio or video version    rated the candidates intellect more highly  than those who read the transcript, the paper reported. Those who listened or watched also rated the candidates more likable and, critically, more employable. The results are said to validate and expand upon previous research showing that the cadence and intonation of voice allows listeners to do a better job of gauging a person s thoughts than the same information communicated in writing.
