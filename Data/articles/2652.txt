Saavn partners with Twitter - will play requests tweeted to @SaavnRadio, other social features coming: Saavn is upping its social game after it partnered with Twitter to introduce a tweet-powered radio station for its users. Saavn launched its radio mode one year ago, and now it is taking requests from users who tweet to the @SaavnRadio account. The station will also mix in tracks that Saavn users are sharing to Twitter from the service, although the company said specific requests will be prioritized over social shares. Saavn Co-Founder and CEO Rishi Malhotra told TechCrunch in an interview that the radio feature already accounts for over half of all activity on the service and, since a large number of users are already active on Twitter, the union was a no-brainer for him.  Music streaming has always been an inherently social service, we [at Saavn] already see lots of activity from users worldwide and identified a natural opportunity to create a radio station. This puts the power of programming into our users  hands,  he said. Malhotra also hinted that Saavn is preparing more social features next year, but he said that these new releases will be within the Saavn service itself, such as collaborative playlists.
