Some of the damage might be lasting though - Alibaba stock is down 15% in a week, and class action lawsuits in the US might follow non-disclosure of SAIC meeting before IPO: Alibaba's representatives discussed the SAIC's claims in meetings with the agency's Internet regulation director, Liu Hongliang, in July about two months before its record-breaking New York Stock Exchange debut. Did Alibaba need to disclose this information before going public  Following the plunge in Alibaba's stock price, which has dropped almost 14 percent since Monday, the class action lawyers are taking aim at the company. Pomerantz, a firm that says it fights "for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct," announced yesterday an investigation for Alibaba investors. Rosen Law Firm is investigating allegations the company "may have issued materially misleading information to the investing public," the New York-based firm announced yesterday. The firm "is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses suffered by [Alibaba] shareholders." Several other law firms have said they're investigating, too. Responding to the law firms' announcements, Alibaba said today in a statement to Bloomberg that it is a company "with strong values" that "will vigorously defend the truth and our reputation."
