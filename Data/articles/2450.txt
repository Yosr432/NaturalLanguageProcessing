As Alibaba and Chinese investors pour into Israel, the nation's high-tech startups scored big exits in 2014: With nearly $15 billion in exits through mergers and acquisitions and public offerings, 2014 was an all-time record year for the Israeli hi-tech industry, compared with a mere $1.2 billion raised in 2013, according to a PwC report for 2014. The exits were spread out between a variety of tech industries, including Internet, IT, life sciences, communications and semiconductors. Semiconductors had a 38% of the share, but just one semiconductor IPO out of the 18 in total. The road accident avoidance technology developerMobilEye raised $1.023 billion in its August IPO, a record an Israeli company. As for new giant exits emerging, most argue that Israel s hi-tech diversity is its strength.  While there seems to be a general hype around IoT, security and fintech, I find Israel to be a very unique place in the fact that entrepreneurs don t tend to have group think and as such, we are seeing ventures tackling a very wide array of industries.  said Yaron Carni, the founder of two Israeli VC fundsMaverick Ventures and Tel Aviv Angel Group. And more international companies are beginning to take notice of Israel s technological strengths. In fact, 2014 ended with a news item that might indicate China s increasingly hefty presence in the Israeli hi-tech sector. Last year might be remembered as the time when Chinese technology companies embraced Israeli startups in a big way. On December 20, The Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba invested in Visualead, a company that specializes in QR code generation. Based in Herzliya, the Israeli equivalent of Silicon Valley, the 15-person start-up was Aliababa s first Israeli acquisition. Last September, China s Yuanda Enterprise Group bought AutoAgronome, a maker of smart irrigation and fertilization systems for $20 million in order to move into high-tech agriculture.
