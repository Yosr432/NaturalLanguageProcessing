Marc Andreessen suddenly deletes all his tweets, goes on Twitter break: he Twittersphere was just a little bit quieter this morning after Marc Andreessen, father of the Tweetstorm, vacated the platform last night. While there s no clear answer from him or others as to why he decided to take a break, Andreessen is not the first popular Silicon Valley figure to abruptly leave the service.Earlier this summer, Sam Altman, President of the Y Combinator Group, left citing community issues on the Twitter platform. He argued that the social network  rewards negativity and snark,  and that he felt  worse after using Twitter.  Of course, even Altman couldn t resist the urge to come back to Twitter after a brief absence. Given Andreessen described his actions as a  break,  it will likely end much in the same way with an eventual return. Twitter as a platform has increasingly come under fire for its dismissive approach to the toxic culture permitting from some of the site s insensitive and trolling users, though Andreessen isn t usually one to back away from divisive conversations.
