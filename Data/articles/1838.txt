Facebook s new Moments app is meant to take the pain out of sharing pictures: Facebook on Monday announced a new mobile photo-sharing app that aims to solve a major modern headache: getting the pictures off of everyone's smartphone. The app uses Facebook's face-tagging technology to identify which friends are in your photos so you can sort through the collection by looking for particular people -- "Photos of Joe," for example. You can use Moments to post pictures to Facebook, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, but albums are set to stay between friends by default. Users also choose to sync certain photos to the app -- as can their friends -- so you won't necessarily have to share every photo you took at a particular event with everyone. The app will be available Monday, for iOS and Android devices. Google Photos, which the company announced earlier this month at its developers conference, goes even further than Facebook and lets you search through your pictures not only for faces but also for things such as "sunsets" or "beaches" to easily sift through your photo library. Apple revamped its iPhoto earlier this year to add pictures to the cloud. Flickr also updated its service this spring to make it easier to sort, sync and share your snapshots.
