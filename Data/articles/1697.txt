Uber having trouble raising China fund, expects to lose $3B over next 3 years, says report in rival-backed tech site: On Tuesday, a report emerged on Chinese tech news site Sina Tech citing a  source close to Uber  as saying that the company has had trouble finding first-tier Chinese investors. Uber has reportedly asked Goldman Sachs for help with finding Chinese investors (a technique it has used before) but the company has thusfar been met with mostly rejections from top-tier Chinese and Asian investors. According to Sina Tech s anonymous source, when Uber first started looking for investors, it wasn t giving out detailed financial information about its China business beyond the somewhat questionable one-million-rides-a-day number it  leaked  earlier this summer. But when investors balked at the lack of information, Uber was forced to cough up more, and those numbers apparently don t look great. Uber reportedly expects to do US$1.1 billion in total sales in China in 2015, but it also expects to post losses of US$1.1 billion there this year. Over the next three years, Uber apparently expects its China business to lose $3 billion. Any report in the Chinese tech press that cites only anonymous sources is worth taking with a grain of salt, of course. And Sina Tech s parent company Sina, through its Sina Weibo subsidiary, does own a share in Uber rival Didi Kuaidi, so  black PR  certainly can t be ruled out. But it does seem odd that Uber still hasn t announced its funding round despite having reportedly nabbed one of Didi Kuaidi s top investors weeks ago.
