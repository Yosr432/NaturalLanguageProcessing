LinkedIn could be an excellent B2B marketing tool, and in fact may already be setting up for a clash with SalesForce: Here s a hypothetical scenario: What if you included some JavaScript from LinkedIn on your company s website so that whenever a signed-in LinkedIn user visited your site, you could see who they were in LinkedIn Sales Navigator  Since the overwhelming majority of potential leads just browse and don t fill in your forms, this would give you insight into a whole new population of potential customers that your Marketo and Salesforce systems can t track. If LinkedIn offered a more sales or marketing automation-style interface, you could select, group or filter those web visitors and send them educational LinkedIn InMails or purchase targeted advertising on LinkedIn or in their LinkedIn email digests. Marketers and salespeople could eventually use LinkedIn to reach new prospects who haven t yet visited their sites. LinkedIn would know which types of users find your company interesting   especially if the company worked itself down the funnel towards Salesforce s territory to offer CRM functions. By knowing the history of your leads (i.e. which ones end up converting to customers), LinkedIn could help you pinpoint your hottest prospects even before they hit one of your landing pages or contact forms.
