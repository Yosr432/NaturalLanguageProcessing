Alibaba Again Named  Notorious Market  in Blow to Overseas Push: Alibaba has again been labeled a haven for knockoffs with an embarrassing return to a U.S. blacklist for fakes just four years after getting its name removed. The U.S. Office of the Trade Representative on Wednesday restored Alibaba s Taobao to its lineup of  Notorious Markets,  citing an unacceptably high level of reported counterfeiting and piracy. The Hangzhou-based company said it was disappointed in the decision. While Alibaba has argued it s doing all it can to combat fakes, Asia s biggest Internet company now finds itself on the same list as torrent website Pirate Bay and flea markets in Brazil and Nigeria. The decision damages Alibaba s credibility in the U.S., where its shares trade and it s trying to cultivate relationships with retailers, brands and entertainment companies. Alibaba suggested its new designation could have been influenced by politics.  Our results speak for themselves,  Alibaba President Mike Evans said in a statement.  Unfortunately, the USTR s decision leads us to question whether the USTR acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate.
