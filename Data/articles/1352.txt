Bill Gurley on Tech Bubble: I m a Pragmatist, Not a Doomsayer:  Bill Gurley, general partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, has developed a reputation as the Nostradamus of Silicon Valley. He has repeatedly called out startups and fellow investors for over-the-top valuations, warning of an impending tech bubble. He isn t ditching that reputation.  It s kind of my responsibility to call it out,  the venture capitalist said at the Vanity Fair Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday.  If you re in a car heading over a cliff and I say,  Hey, slow down    that s being a pragmatist, not being a doomsayer.  New York Times reporter Nick Bilton, who moderated the panel, asked Gurley how he squares that view with the fact that Benchmark is among the venture firms priming startups with cash. Gurley s retort: The founders he backs could raise money in any condition   and could do it even better when funding dries up.  Most of the great CEOs I work with want this to stop. They re forced to play this game,  he replied.  Great entrepreneurs raise money in any cycle. When there s less money available, the better entrepreneurs have the advantage.
