An Expert in Valuation Says Uber Is Only Worth $28 Billion, Not $62.5 Billion: According to Aswath Damodaran, a professor who specializes in equity valuation at NYU's Stern School of Business, Uber is running up against the roadblock that has thwarted many upstart businesses: Profit. While Damodaran thinks Uber and riding sharing will continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, he's concerned about whether revenues will follow. China especially worries him given Uber's recent sale of its operations in that country to Didi Chuxing, its biggest rival there. The decision to exit "even if it was the right one from the perspective of saving itself from a cash war, will reduce its potential revenues in the future."  In the other places where Uber does continue to operate, there are often large discounts for riders and other special promotions. This is proof that the business model is challenged, according to Damodaran. "I believe that a significant portion of their expenses are associating with maintaining revenues rather than growing them," he says. "In effect, it looks like the business model that has brought these companies as far as they have in such a short time period are flawed, because what allowed these companies to grow incredibly fast is getting in the way of converting revenues to profits, since there are no moats to defend." Damodaran says that young companies all face a point in time that he calls the "Bar Mitzvah Moment," when the focus shifts from growth to evidence that the business model can be profitable. In his mind, that moment is right now for ride sharing. "After an initial life, where investors have been easily sated with reports of more ride sharing usage (number of cities served, rides, drivers etc.), these investors are starting to ask the tough questions about how ride sharing companies propose turning these impressive usage statistics into profits."
