As Paris forms a special police unit to spot clandestine taxis; Uber gives drivers tips on how to avoid detection: Uber Technologies Inc. drivers in Paris are adding a new word to their vocabulary: Boers. That s the nickname of a special police unit whose responsibilities include spotting clandestine taxis. The 70-person squad has now the added task of enforcing a taxi law that bans practices including some used by the car-hailing smartphone application s UberPop rides with unlicensed chauffeurs. Since January, some 110 drivers have been handed tickets. The fines start from a few hundred euros and can theoretically reach several thousands, according to a police official, who asked not to be named citing department policy. In France, where Uber says it has signed up a million users -- including 250,000 for UberPop -- in just over three years, the crackdown is the latest episode in a long legal battle where cab drivers say the startup unfairly threatened their livelihoods. Uber disagrees with the ban, backed by a Paris judge who studied the taxi law and ruled in December not to block the service. To avoid police attention, at least seven UberPop drivers Bloomberg News spoke to in the past week said they had been told by the company not to position their smartphones in plain sight when running the app, and to ask passengers to ride in the front seat. They declined to give their full names for fear of reprimand by Uber. Uber s Simphal confirmed those guidelines. The company also regularly e-mails newsletters to drivers with advice on regulation and other topics, he said.  We always support the drivers,  Simphal said, when asked whether Uber reimburses them for fine tickets.
