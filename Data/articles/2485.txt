Virtual reality goggles, drones and data centers are all driving a hiring spree at Facebook Inc (FB.O) that is set to swell its ranks as much as 14 percent in the near term, according to a review of job listings on the company's website. Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality headsets that Facebook acquired in a $2 billion deal last year, is among the key areas slated for growth, with 54 jobs listed on its website, according to a review by Reuters of listings. Among the roles that Facebook needs to fill for the Oculus business are managers to oversee logistics, procurement and global supply chain planning - a sign, some analysts say, that the product is nearing its commercial release. Facebook s ambitious effort to build its own satellites and drones capable of delivering Internet service to remote regions of the world is another important area for hiring: the program has Facebook searching for specialists in areas such as avionics, radio frequency communications and thermal engineering. Atlas, the online advertising technology that Facebook acquired in 2013, is another big area of hiring, with more than 20 open positions listed. Facebook had 8,348 full-time employees at the end of September, far fewer than Google s roughly 55,000 employees or Microsoft Corp s (MSFT.O) roughly 127,000 (Microsoft announced in the summer that it plans to cut 18,000 jobs). At the same time, Facebook gets more out of each employee, according to calculations using company revenue figures. Facebook s revenue works out to roughly $384,000 per employee in the third quarter of 2014, versus $300,000 for Google and $183,000 for Microsoft.
