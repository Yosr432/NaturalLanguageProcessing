Apple Pay Insight #2: Apple's timing might be excellent (as usual): By next fall, though, American merchants face a deadline to upgrade their credit card terminals to accept E.M.V.   which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa   a technology that makes credit transactions more secure for consumers. Many believe those new terminals will also accept payments from Near Field Communication-enabled devices like the iPhone 6.  Apple s timing here is an astute stroke of brilliance,  said Norm Merritt, president of ShopKeep, a start-up that sells point-of-sale products for small businesses.  People will already have to invest in new E.M.V.-enabled machines. N.F.C. is just a few bucks more.  Apple is also promoting Apple Pay s security measures, calling it far safer than the credit cards consumers use on a daily basis.
