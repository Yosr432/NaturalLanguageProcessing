Google Will Let Mobile Games Stream in Search So That Mobile Game Makers Will Buy Search Ads: Google will let you try out a mobile game right inside the search results page, before downloading it. And Google will let game developers pay for the privilege. It s part of Google s ongoing effort to squeeze more ad revenue from mobile and its business cornerstone, search. For developers, the trick offers a new avenue   paid search   for recruiting new users. Most money for gamers is made inside the app, so some developers may be reluctant to move away from direct downloads. But, in theory, the streaming method lets them grab devoted game players who have tried out the game, like it, and will stick around and buy stuff therein. For Google, it s another way to nab the ample flow of app promotional dollars   a flow that Facebook has largely cornered. Over the past year, Google has rolled out a stream of mobile app advertising tools as the company has prioritized ways to fortify its central business. It added ads to the Play store so developers could pay to get noticed there. In November, Google started testing app streaming in organic search results with a handful of apps; it brought the feature to ads within apps a month later. Now, developers can promote their apps with streaming inside search, too. Google s share of app advertising is rising steadily, although Facebook is still out in front, according to industry sources.
