Samsung Beats Analyst Predictions Despite Falling Profits: After a tough 2014 for Samsung Electronics, the beleaguered South Korean manufacturer said it expected earnings in the first quarter of 2015 to beat analyst forecasts, in an early sign of a possible turnaround for the company. In a news release, Samsung said its operating profit was likely to have fallen about 30 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2014. Despite the drop, Samsung exceeded analyst expectations by posting an operating profit of about 5.9 trillion won, or $5.4 billion, in the quarter, down from 8.5 trillion won a year earlier. Sales totaled about 47 trillion won, down roughly 12 percent from 53.7 trillion won a year earlier. The figures are preliminary; Samsung will post final earnings later this month. Samsung s forecast signals the sixth consecutive quarter of decline in operating profit, and highlights how competitive pressure from Chinese rivals at the low end of the market and Apple s iPhone at the high end has been squeezing Samsung.
