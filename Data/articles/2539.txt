After stellar year, Facebook stock finds doubters on rising opex, slowing growth (2015F 37% Y/Y, 2014F 57% Y/Y) : Facebook, up 195 percent in two years and trading at a record last month, is starting to draw skeptics in the options market. Options betting on a decline in Facebook cost the most versus bullish contracts since July 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Options with an exercise price 10 percent below the shares cost 3.1 points more than calls and climbed to 3.3 points above on Dec. 23, according to three-month implied-volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the one-year average of 1.3 points.   We re not banking on seeing Facebook repeat the same great performance it had in 2014,  said Uppington, a technology portfolio manager at Lombard Odier in Geneva. His company oversees $50 billion.  It s also seeing an increase in operating expenses. The company needs to invest in growth to overcome the law of large numbers.  Operating expenses rose in the third quarter at the fastest pace since the first three months of 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Menlo Park, California-based company has purchased applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp Inc. to increase its appeal to younger users and drive mobile advertising sales. Now analysts predict profit and revenue growth in 2015 won t keep pace with the increases from last year. Facebook earnings will gain 12 percent this year after nearly doubling in 2014, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will climb 37 percent after rising 57 percent last year, the projections show.
