It s Amazon and Also-Rans in Retailers  Race for Online Sales: Two decades after Jeffrey P. Bezos started Amazon in his Bellevue, Wash., garage, his e-commerce juggernaut could be forgiven for letting up on its rapid growth. Not Amazon, though, which steamrolled through 2015, capturing an ever-growing share of United States retail sales. Of every additional $1 Americans spent for items online this year, Amazon captured 51 cents, according to a recent estimate by analysts at Macquarie Research.

But they realized they would never make any money that way. They evolved,  he said.  It s much a different company than it was five years ago.
