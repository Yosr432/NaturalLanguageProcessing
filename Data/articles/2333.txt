Alibaba's stock price has dipped below its first day close; is down 27% from its Nov 2014 peak: Alibaba, which held one of last year s most high-profile initial public offerings, has drawn investors wanting to benefit from e-commerce traffic in China, the world s largest Internet market. The company has come under pressure from shareholders in recent weeks after it reported quarterly revenue that failed to meet analysts  estimates. The stock fell 2.5 percent to $86.85 at Tuesday s close in New York, less than the closing price of $93.89 on Sept. 19, its first day of trading, though still above the initial sale price of $68. Starboard Value LP, an activist hedge fund, also acquired an Alibaba stake of 400,000 shares in the fourth quarter. The investor earlier took a stake in Yahoo! Inc., which owns about 15 percent of Alibaba, and pushed for the Web portal to monetize the stake in a tax-friendly manner. Last month, Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo said it would spin off the Chinese holdings in a deal that should wrap up by the end of the year. Hedge fund Tiger Global Management acquired 5.8 million shares, or 0.24 percent of Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba, at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sands Capital Management more than doubled its stake to 19.6 million shares, or 0.8 percent. T. Rowe Price reduced its holdings by 17 percent to 22.3 million shares, a 0.9 percent stake.
