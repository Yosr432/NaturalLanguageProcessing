Hewlett-Packard Bucks Market s Plunge After Earnings Report: Hewlett-Packard squeezed out a gain amid Friday s market plunge after issuing an earnings report that kept negative surprises to a minimum. For the first time in several quarters HP did not mention unexpected bad news,  Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note to investors advising they buy the stock.  Previous quarters HP reduced cash flows, stated higher separation costs, more unplanned restructuring and costs, etc. We now believe the bad news is over.  Hewlett-Packard s shares rose less than 1 percent to close at $27.47 after advancing as much as 7.6 percent earlier in the day. The stock gave up most of the increase as the Standard & Poor s 500 Index tumbled 3.2 percent, marking the gauge s worst day in almost four years. Hewlett-Packard sales declined across most divisions in the fiscal third quarter. PC shipments fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter, and companies are spending less on software and services.
