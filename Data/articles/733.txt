Kahoot App Brings Urgency of a Quiz Show to the Classroom: Kahoot, an online quiz system from Norway that is fast gaining market share in schools across the United States, plays out like a television game show spliced with a video game. Cast in the role of game host, teachers introduce a multiple-choice quiz   on, say, plant life or English grammar. Using the Kahoot platform, they project one quiz question at a time onto a whiteboard or screen at the front of their classrooms. Players typically have 30 seconds to click an answer on their laptops, tablets or smartphones. They earn points for correct choices, and extra points for clicking faster. During the answer period, Kahoot emits a catchy countdown tune, reminiscent of retro video games like Monkey Island. A gong sounds when time is up, and the classroom board immediately tallies the class s correct and incorrect answers. Next, a leaderboard appears, ranking the top five students by points accrued. Kahoot s gamelike features and easy-to-use format have helped turn it into a classroom phenomenon. Of the 55 million elementary and secondary school students in the United States, about 20 million used Kahoot last month, the company said.  It s fun. Everyone is doing it. It pulls all the children in,  Tosh McGaughy, a digital learning specialist at the Birdville Independent School District in Haltom City, Tex., told me recently.  They get competitive and excited.
