As More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money: Something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become d class . For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits. Silicon Valley s sudden distaste for the IPO.   rooted in part in Wall Street s skepticism of new tech stocks   may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill. It also means Wall Street is doing what it failed to do in the last tech boom: using traditional metrics like growth and profitability to price companies. Investors have been tough on Twitter, for example, because its user growth has slowed. They have been tough on Box, the cloud-storage company that went public last year, because it remains unprofitable. And the e-commerce company Zulily, which went public last year, was likewise punished when it cut its guidance for future sales. During a recent presentation for Andreessen Horowitz s limited partners   the institutions that give money to the venture firm   Marc Andreessen, the firm s co-founder, told the journalist Dan Primack that he had never seen a sharper divergence in how investors treat public- and private-company chief executives.  They tell the public C.E.O.,  Give us the money back this quarter,  and they tell the private C.E.O.,  No problem, go for 10 years,    Mr. Andreessen said.
