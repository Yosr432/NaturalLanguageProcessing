In-store location targeting is going mainstream this US Holiday Season: Beginning this week, shoppers at Tysons Corner Center with the right app may see a welcome message pop up on their smartphones as they walk into the mall. An hour into their shopping spree, they are likely to receive another text message, this time asking if they d like their purchases delivered to their home. And if they have questions along the way   does Nordstrom offer gift wrapping or when does California Pizza Kitchen open   they can get instant answers via text messaging. The property is one of a handful of shopping centers around the country experimenting with mobile apps and Bluetooth technology to communicate with customers as they move through the mall. Ugg this month opened its first high-tech store at the Tysons Galleria, where it uses the same wireless sensors that are in E-Z Passes to help shoppers customize boots and find related products on large in-store touch screens. At Burberry s new outpost at CityCenterDC, which opened in August, company iPads are available for online shopping. And at Inspirato, a luxury vacation company with a new  experience center  at the Tysons Galleria, passersby can use a number of on-site computers and touch screens to browse lodges in Jackson Hole, Wyo., or chateaus in Bordeaux, France.
