Bad news for Google #3: A TechCrunch columnist rips YouTube's product as stagnant and compares it to Yahoo: The great story of Silicon Valley: A company, once ahead of its time, ceases to innovate for almost a decade while continuing to make billions off its legacy business model   ad sales. Then that once-great company dies. In the proud American tradition of AOL, Yahoo, and GeoCities, I present YouTube. Ever notice how its homepage looks almost the same as it did in 2008  For the first time in a decade, YouTube s dominance as the destination for video content is being challenged by rivals like Facebook. While the press admires the success of Bethany Mota and tours the lush new coastal YouTube studios, Facebook has spotted the company s many weaknesses and is going on the attack 1. The dominant image is an advertisement (gross). 2. I have no interest in any of that recommended content. 3. I have no idea how that content surfaced to my main pain in the first place, which makes me think YouTube is kinda dumb. 4. I have no way to feed back into YouTube s algorithm and say I hate their content, as suggested, for  me.  5. The content is presented void of any context. How about some editorial, ratings, written jokes, or any other myriad ways that it could be made more meaningful  6. Even BuzzFeed knows point No. 5, and they are the intellectual toilet of the Internet. Fix: Copy the Gawker  bored at work  business model; hire some editors. YouTube should challenge itself to perform more like BuzzFeed, which, for all its faults, does immediately engage the user off of its homepage content and context.
