Buggy Bluetooth and unreliable voice recognition systems are now top drivers of car-buyer dissatisfaction, JD Power survey reveals: As communications systems proliferate in cars, they are becoming the biggest source of aggravation for owners, according to a study by the market research firm J.D. Power. From buggy Bluetooth systems to voice recognition systems that do not recognize voices, the problems with in-car computer systems have surpassed excessive wind noise as the most-cited issue. Of owners who had problems with their Bluetooth systems, 55 percent said their vehicle would not recognize their phone and 31 percent said the phone would not automatically connect when they entered the vehicle. The No. 2 problem was voice recognition systems misinterpreting commands. Effective voice recognition is seen as a critical function in cars if consumers are to be discouraged from distracted driving. Google and Apple are poised to enter the market widely, with new dashboard computer systems that will allow consumers to use their smartphones. The study also showed that technology was playing an increasingly important role in buying decisions. Fifteen percent of new-car buyers said they avoided a model because it lacked certain technological features, up from 4 percent in last year s study. The study covered 177 specific problems grouped into eight major vehicle systems like exterior, seats, steering, suspension, braking and engine and transmission. J.D. Power then ranked brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles; the lower the number of problems, the higher the ranking.
