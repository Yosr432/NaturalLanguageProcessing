Google Talent Departs for Unicorn Herd: Cloudera taps Google VP as Engineering Head, DropBox poaches Neal Mohan for top job: Cloud analytics software company Cloudera said today it has named Daniel Sturman as its VP of engineering. Sturman previously spent eight years at Google, where as VP of engineering he was in charge of keeping its computing infrastructure for services like Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine. Neal Mohan, Google s VP for display and video advertising, is leaving for the top product job at Dropbox. He is part of a wave of execs departing the search engine in recent months for fast-growing, pre-IPO startups. More recently, Uber claimed Tom Fallows, who had led Google s same-day delivery service, in November, followed by communication and policy chief Rachel Whetstone. Jawbone nabbed Fallows s boss, Sameer Samat. Indian e-commerce unicorn Flipkart snatched two Googlers: The VP of product at Motorola and the person who ran the low-cost handset Android One project. On the smaller startup side, the ads product head at YouTube recently headed to Luxe, an on-demand parking startup. There s more, but you get the idea. Google downplays exits, citing them as regular industry churn. But they come as Google s core business faces rising threats and fears that it has grown too large and too uninspired to retain ambitious top tech talent. Apparently, the Google bench is not as rewarding for some as the thrill of a unicorn ride.
