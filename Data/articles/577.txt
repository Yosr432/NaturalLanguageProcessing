Nest CEO Tony Fadell is out: Tony Fadell, the CEO and co-founder of Nest, is leaving the company two years after his connected device firm was acquired by Google. Fadell announced his departure in a tweet on Friday, capping off a rocky tenure under the search giant, which reorganized itself as Alphabet in August and placed Fadell at the helm of his independent company. Marwan Fawaz, a former Motorola executive and adviser to the home security company ADT, is joining as Nest CEO. The move comes after a series of public dramas and critical departures at Nest, which has failed to meet initial expectations since Google acquired it for over $3 billion two years ago. As we reported, Nest brought in around $340 million in revenue last year   short of the goals set before the company acquired the videocamera startup Dropcam. That acquisition, by all measures, went terribly: Most of the Dropcam team departed, largely due to the frustrations of working under Fadell. Dropcam CEO Greg Duffy voiced those frustrations very publicly, writing that he regretted selling his company to Nest and Google. Fadell will stay on as an adviser to Larry Page, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, the company said in a statement. Several sources have said that a major issue for Nest was the integration of corporate cultures. Fadell, a former Apple executive, brought several others from that company and tried to retain Apple's unique, tenacious culture. That often clashed with Google's more open, experimental ethos, a fact that many Googlers noted often in many forums.
