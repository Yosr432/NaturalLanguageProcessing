Uber terms of service face scrutiny as firm faces the possibility of legal action in India following arrest of rape suspect: Madhur Verma, New Delhi police deputy commissioner, said that police will also take legal action against Uber   valued at $40 billion   for failure to run checks on the driver s background and whether he had an adequate GPS device in his car. The police are taking legal advice before deciding whether it would be a criminal or civil case. Earlier reports suggest that the suspect had disabled GPS during the incident, which occurred late on Friday night or early Saturday morning. The suspect allegedly parked the car in a secluded area after the passenger, said to be in her mid-twenties, fell asleep. He then raped her and threatened her life if she reported anything. Shockingly enough, Uber s terms of service don t necessarily protect against this. You can have a read through it right here, if you d like, but the main argument is this: Uber is not a transportation company, but rather a technology service that matches seekers of transportation (riders) with providers of transportation (drivers). By using Uber, and accepting the obligatory ToS, you are acknowledging that each and every driver that picks you up in any city in the world is a third-party (not Uber), and thus, Uber is not responsible for any of their actions. This is hardly the first time that a dispute (to put it lightly) has arisen between an Uber driver and a passenger or pedestrian. One man was hit over the head with a hammer, and a six-year-old girl was killed when hit by a driver. This isn t even the first rape allegation against an Uber driver.
