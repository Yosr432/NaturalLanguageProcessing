Google s Moonshots Cost Lots of Money, but Running Google Costs Even More: For years, Larry Page told Wall Street he wasn t blowing all of Google s money on crazy bets like self-driving cars and smart contact lenses. Turns out, he was right. If the first dual-structure Alphabet earnings showed us anything, it s that the biggest costs for the Internet giant are not from its various non-Google projects. They re from Google itself. Case in point: In 2015, capital expenditure   servers, real estate and stuff like that   ran $8.85 billion for Google s core business. Cap ex for the Alphabet remainder   from the self-driving cars to the Fiber broadband business to two biotech companies   was far less, at $869 million. Operating loss for those units was just north of $3 billion. That is, Google spent more than twice as much on its basic ad business than on its change-the-world projects. The reason  Running core Google is still expensive   particularly the massive data server infrastructure, which remains part of Google. So is its very large and very expensive research division, despite the fact that lots of that work, like its artificial intelligence and VR efforts, end up in other Alphabet projects, such as autonomous vehicles.
