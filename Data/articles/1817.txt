Chinese government deals help nurse Alibaba's bottom dog cloud business: Alibaba is an underdog in the global cloud computing industry, but it has one thing going for it: it's Chinese. The firm scored a minor deal with China's northeastern port city of Dalian to build a cloud computing center and provide online government services such as bill payment.The pact is a small part of a growing portfolio of similar cloud services tie-ups between Alibaba and government bodies around China and comes against a backdrop of Beijing's deepening paranoia about foreign technology. The domestic alliances will help Alibaba's cloud unit Aliyun, literally "Ali Cloud", build scale and gain experience before any global campaign to challenge market leaders Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google. "China wants control of its information, of its data, of its news, of its technology food chain, and so there are huge opportunities." For the time being, Aliyun is small.It accounted for just 1 percent of Alibaba's overall revenue for the year ended March 31. But it says in China it has the biggest market share in cloud computing. Aliyun has forged cloud agreements with more than a dozen Chinese provinces and cities including Hainan, Guangdong, Tianjin and Shanghai. It also works with China Meteorological Administration, China Central Government Procurement Center and the state railway service center. The deals range from developing cloud storage solutions to helping the government of the southern province of Guizhou gather and crunch data to optimize its traffic lights. Aliyun in April announced a deal with state oil and gas giant Sinopec, to create a cloud system to track its petrochemical production chain and emissions. Cheng Jing, an Aliyun director who deals with government agencies, said his primary consideration was the bottom line. "First, we have to be sure that our services can make money. If these services can also promote Ali's relationship with the government then that's a good thing."
