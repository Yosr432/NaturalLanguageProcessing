Credit Suisse Says Instagram Is Going to Have a Huge Year: Facebook Inc.'s purchase of Instagram Inc. continues to look smarter and smarter. After buying Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG now expect Facebook will get more than triple that price tag in revenue from the photo sharing app this year alone. "We are now forecasting $572.5 million and [circa] $3.2 billion in revenue contribution from Instagram in [the first quarter of 2016] and 2016, respectively," analysts led by Stephen Ju said in a recent note. Instagram and premium video will be a big driver for mobile and desktop ad revenue, the team writes. "Our projection for consolidated ad revenue of $5.24 billion in [the first quarter] reflects our projection for $573 million and $260 million in contribution from Facebook's Instagram and premium video ad product, respectively."  When Facebook acquired the startup, it had roughly 30 million users. Monthly active users have now ballooned to 400 million as of September 2015, topping that of Twitter Inc. Much of the recent expansion has been outside of the U.S.
