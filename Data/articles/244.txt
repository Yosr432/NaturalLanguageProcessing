Instagram Puts Ads on Stories Feature as Users Reach 150 Million: Instagram will start to introduce advertising to its stories feature as it becomes more popular, stepping up competition with Snap Inc. Facebook Inc. s Instagram said it now has 150 million daily users on the stories feature of its photo-sharing site that was inspired by a popular Snapchat product, which broadcasts short videos that disappear after they re viewed, or after 24 hours. Instagram s number for stories matches the statistic Snapchat gives for its total daily global audience. Advertisers  love vertical video and they love sound on,  Quarles said, noting that 70 percent of stories watchers do so with sound.  That s where stories, from a format standpoint, is so interesting to them.  Snapchat was a pioneer in advocating for vertical video, which takes up the entire screen on a mobile phone, as opposed to horizontal video designed first for television screens -- the primary format in Facebook s news feed. Instagram s rival, owned by Snap Inc., is gearing up for an initial public offering, planned for as soon as March this year.
