Facebook Brings 360 Dynamic Streaming To Samsung Gear VR, Forms Social VR Team: Zuck shocked everyone by appearing on stage for the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event for MWC 2016. He wasn t there to push Samsung s new phones or talk about Messenger, his time onstage was all about virtual reality. Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook (which, in case if you ve forgotten, is the parent company of Oculus) will be bringing its dynamic streaming technology for 360 video to Gear VR (which, in case if you ve forgotten, is powered by Oculus). This technology allows significant performance upgrades to streaming content by only playing back what s in view of the headset at any given time rather than processing the entire 360 sphere of video at once. All of this is done by seamlessly switching between dozens of variants of each 360 video taken from multiple angles. Facebook revealed more about the technology at its Video @Scale event last month. The results speak for themselves, Facebook says their efforts have  quadrupled the resolution quality of 360 streaming video in VR by reducing the amount of required network bandwidth by 4x.  Another interesting tidbit comes from a Facebook blog post today they re building a social VR team to focus  entirely on exploring the future of social interaction in VR.
