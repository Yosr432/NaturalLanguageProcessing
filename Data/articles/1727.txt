Worldwide spend on gadgets will fall year-on-year this year for the first time since 2010: According to a new forecast from Gartner, shoppers worldwide will spend less on gadgets in 2015 than they did in 2014   the first drop since 2010. Analysts from Gartner still predict we'll spend a total of $606 billion in 2015. But it's still a decline of 5.7 percent compared with 2014   lower than Gartner had forecast just three months ago. So what's behind the softer sales  Its because sales of desktops, tablets and smartphones are all slowing. Fewer people are buying desktop computers in Western Europe, Japan and Russia. In addition the tablet market is reaching its saturation point, and that analysts expect users to upgrade their tablets an average of once every three years   far less than smartphones. Sales of mobile devices such as smartphones as well as of high-end laptops will continue to grow, the firm said. Still, even within that bright spot, there is some hint of a slowdown. The rates of first-time smartphone buyers in China, one of the world's fastest-growing and most important mobile markets, have slowed.
