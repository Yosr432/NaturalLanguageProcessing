PayPal s Instant Checkout  One Touch  Aims to Boost Conversion Rates on Mobile, No Longer Requires PayPal s App: PayPal s instant checkout service called OneTouch is now being extended to support all merchants using the e-commerce platform Bigcommerce, as well as on mobile devices   even in cases where the consumer doesn t have the PayPal native application installed. The service, which allows customers to check out from an online merchant without having to enter their username and password, launched publicly last fall on mobile devices then expanded to the web in April. One Touch was originally designed to improve the conversion rates for online transactions. On mobile in particular, consumers tend to abandon purchases simply because of the challenges associated with entering in their personal information payment card details on mobile s small screen. PayPal s move to counter this trend was OneTouch for Mobile, which allows a customer s information to be stored and shared between supported apps. That means that customers would only have to enter their PayPal credentials for their first mobile purchase, but subsequent purchases could be made with just one tap. The system is currently being used by a number of merchants including Jane.com, ParkWhiz, StubHub, Threadless, Airbnb, Lyft and Munchery, for example. In April, PayPal announced that it would offer similar functionality to web-based merchants as well, which meant the product now had the potential to reach PayPal s 165 million customers. Despite being an older player in the ever-changing payments industry where newer contenders including Stripe, and now Apple Pay, are finding their ways into mobile apps and online stores, PayPal s payments business is still growing. The company reported its net total payment volume rose 18 percent to $61 billion, it said in April, and it added 3.6 million new accounts in the quarter. The company says that today, online and mobile shopping accounts for $2.5 trillion in annual retail sales, and PayPal processes nearly 12.5 million payments for its customers daily. The move towards digital payments over physical payments is also a factor in PayPal s growth. It notes that a couple of years ago, half of transactions involved checks or cash, but in a couple years  time, they ll account for only 25 percent of transactions.
