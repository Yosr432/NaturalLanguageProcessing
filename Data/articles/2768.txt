Xiaomi is moving user data out of China - possibly in response to security concerns, including some from the Indian Air Force: User data for those based outside of China is being moved to servers operated by Amazon.com in California and Singapore, Xiaomi Vice President Hugo Barra wrote today on his Google+ page. All shopping data for international users is expected to be moved out of Beijing by the end of the month, while profiles, text messages and other services should be completed by the end of the year, Barra wrote. In August, security firm F-Secure alleged that Xiaomi's devices were collecting and transmitting personal data to Beijing. The Indian Air Force made similar accusations, according to a report from the New Indian Express newspaper. Apart from privacy, Barra also said the moving data to overseas servers has significantly boosted speed in markets such as Singapore, India and Malaysia. Xiaomi is targeting India and Brazil as its next big markets. This, while Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai to discuss protecting user data two days after a report that (possibly Chinese-backed) hackers targeted its iCloud services.
