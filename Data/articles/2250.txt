Hot Billion $ Rumor#2: Snapdeal might raise $ 700 million from Foxconn(Taiwan): Snapdeal.com, has attracted interest from Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group, one of the world s largest contract electronics manufacturing firms, to raise as much as $600-700 million in a fresh round of funding, at least two sources familiar with the matter told Techcircle.in. However, the talks are still at a preliminary stage and the company is yet to issue a term sheet.  Foxconn is world s biggest contract electronics manufacturer. But they are now finding new growth drivers as revenue from the contract manufacturing business is slowing down. India being a huge retail market, this is a great opportunity for them,  said one of the persons mentioned above.
