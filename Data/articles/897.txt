IHOP Is Releasing Special Snapchat Geolocation Filters, but You Have to Visit the Restaurant to Use Them - The Geo-fencing feature is all about engagement: IHOP today announced a Snapchat campaign that targets patrons inside its restaurants. To push its Double-Dipped French Toast, the all-day breakfast brand is essentially using the same custom geo-filters Snapchat introduced to the masses on Monday. But it's working directly with the Los Angeles social app to serve the ad just to IHOP customers. IHOP and Snapchat developed what they are calling "chain geo-filters," location-based dynamic art that can be added to photo and video snaps. When using the app at a restaurant, customers who take a snap will be able to swipe to reveal IHOP-themed creative overlays. Kirk Thompson, IHOP's vp of marketing, told Adweek that his team quietly released its custom Snapchat filter a few days ago, and it's already garnered 3 million views. On why the new promotion is only zeroing in on people already in stores, he explained, "IHOP receives Snapchats from users every day, a lot of them taken while in our restaurant. Introducing customized filters was a great way to further engage with our guests and at the same time extend our brand message when they share that content with their friends."
