After its Bluekai acquisition in February, Oracle is close by buying Datalogix, another audience-data major; Purchase likely exceeds $500 million Datalogix, whose clients include PepsiCo and HauteLook, helps brands measure media purchases against in-store sales. Datalogix has been an important partner to Facebook as the latter has attempted to show marketers that it can connect the dots between its social ads and offline purchases. Adexchanger reported that Facebook was one of Datalogix's suitors, along with Nielsen and Adobe. But Oracle ultimately nabbed Datalogix, which makes its new Redwood City, Calif.-based parent a more formidable marketing cloud player for clients like General Motors. The company will be able to boast a wealth of online and offline data to compete against rivals Adobe and Salesforce. The Datalogix price tag probably well exceeded $500 million. "Oracle is purchasing Datalogix for an amount we expect will be in the high hundreds of millions of dollars," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, in an email. Wieser added that Datalogix "analyzes, segments and distributes data for use by marketers, and then analyzes data again post-campaign. While these functions are not unique to Datalogix, there is likely some experiential advantage that Datalogix has established in the processes it uses, and the Facebook relationship is a key one which is also relatively (although not entirely) unique."
