What is Pok mon Go and why is everybody talking about it : This new Pok mon game is bringing augmented reality mainstream.It s a new mobile game, free on both iOS and Android, that lets you create an avatar that can catch, train, trade and battle Pok mon characters inside the game. That sounds familiar. Isn t that the premise of virtually every other Pok mon game  Yes, kinda. What makes this game unique is that it uses your phone s location services and camera so that you can catch Pok mon in real life. That is, when you walk around the streets of whatever city or town you live in, your avatar moves inside the game. So finding new Pok mon and checkpoints for the game actually requires you to get off the couch and walk down the block. How does this work  The game uses Google Maps technology to place your avatar on a virtual world that mirrors your real life surroundings. When you find a Pok mon, the game uses augmented reality (AR) to make it look like whatever Pok mon you ve stumbled across is indeed standing right there in front of you. Who created Pok mon Go  Nintendo and the other creators of Pok mon teamed up with Niantic Labs to create the game. The former company was born inside Google; its founder, John Hanke, was a key leader of its Geo products (Google Maps, Earth). After moving to leave Google in 2010, Hanke was lured to stay with funding for Niantic, a skunkworks project to build mobile AR tools using Google Maps technology. Niantic s first effort, Ingress   an augmented-reality, massively multiplayer, location-based online game   cultivated a small but very dedicated following. Niantic spun out of Google in the fall, yet the search giant stayed involved, participating in a $30 million investment for developing Pok mon Go.
