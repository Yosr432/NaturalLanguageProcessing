Dismal Twitter Forecast and Flat User Growth Send Its Stock Lower: On Tuesday, Twitter gave a dismal forecast for its fourth-quarter revenue and profits. Shares in Twitter, a social media company, plunged as much as 13 percent in after-hours trading as Mr. Dorsey and his lieutenants offered little explanation for the gloom in a conference call with investors. In a similar call three months ago, Mr. Dorsey s pointed critique of Twitter s product failings sent the stock down 11 percent. Twitter also reported revenue of $569 million for the quarter, up 58 percent from $361 million a year ago. Its net loss was $132 million, or 20 cents a share, compared to a loss of $175 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, usually the strongest thanks to holiday advertising, Twitter warned that revenue would be $695 million to $710 million, well below the $740 million that Wall Street had been expecting. The new projections, delivered as the company exceeded analysts  expectations for its third-quarter results, provided fresh evidence that Twitter is failing to win over advertisers, the source of most of its revenue, as it confronts stiffening competition from Facebook, Instagram and Google.  The company is finding real challenges gaining traction with advertisers,  said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst with RBC Capital Markets, citing the new forecasts and an advertiser survey his firm conducts twice a year. Mr. Mahaney, who has a neutral rating on Twitter s stock, said he was struck by the contrast between the upbeat tone of Twitter s executives on the call and the company s deteriorating outlook.  Everything sounds so good, yet you reduced your forecast pretty materially. Why   Mr. Dorsey didn t answer that question, although Adam Bain, the company s former ad chief and new chief operating officer, offered a clue: Ad prices plunged 39 percent in the third quarter, which he said was partly because of improved efficiency of video ads.
