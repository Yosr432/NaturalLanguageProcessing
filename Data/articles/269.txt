AppDynamics posts long-awaited IPO filing: AppDynamics has revealed its filing for a U.S. IPO. The IT company, which helps businesses like Salesforce and IBM with applications management, is targeting a $100 million offering. Despite a competitive landscape, which includes New Relic and Dynatrace, AppDynamics has shown strong revenue growth over the past year. For the nine months ending in October, revenue came in at $158.4 million, compared to $102.8 million in the same period during the year prior, driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Losses widened slightly, with the company losing $95.1 million through October versus $92.4 million in the same period the year before. This means that last year, the losses were almost as high as AppDynamics  revenue. AppDynamics has raised more than $300 million in funding over the past eight years and its largest shareholders are Greylock Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which each own 20.8 percent of the company. AppDynamics  last known private market valuation stood at $1.9 billion. Revealing the filing right now suggests that the company is hoping to finally go public in late January or early February.
