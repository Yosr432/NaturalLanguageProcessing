Airtel backs off from its plan to charge higher rates for online voice calls, will await regulations on net neutrality: Indian telecom company Airtel will temporarily withdraw the decision to charge a higher rate for making online voice calls on its data network. Airtel last week announced a new plan to charge customers for data usage on instant messaging and VoIP apps like Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, and Line. But now the telecom operator has decided to wait for a regulatory framework to be put in place, according to a statement today from Airtel. Indian telecom regulator TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar had earlier stated that that while Airtel s move was going against the concept of net neutrality, it was not illegal as there is no policy or regulatory framework in India which mandates operators to adhere to net neutrality. Net neutrality is the notion that service providers must not differentiate between the traffic that flows over their network so that every user and service has equal access to the network.
