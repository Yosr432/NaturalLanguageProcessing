Twitter Shares Climb 8% on NFL Deal, Executive Stock Purchases: Twitter s stock rose 8.2 percent on Monday after it unveiled a content deal with the National Football League and executives said they re buying shares in the company. On Friday, the stock had closed at its lowest level since its November 2013 initial public offering, a slump that began in July when Jack Dorsey, co-founder and interim chief executive officer, warned that it will take a while before Twitter is able to reverse a slowdown in user growth. Today, Dorsey promoted his purchase of about $875,000 in shares with a tweet saying,  Investing in @twitter s future.  Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto and board member Peter Fenton also bought Twitter shares last week, according to regulatory filings. It s not the first time Twitter s executives have coordinated their actions when confidence was low. Before reporting disappointing first-quarter sales, Twitter s insiders halted all their sales for a few weeks.
