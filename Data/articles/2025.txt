Startup Works to Translate Videos Into Structured Data: Vu Digital is launching new technology to help customers figure out what s actually going on inside web online videos. B. Wade Smith, the company s vice president of operations and development, said that as more and more online content moves to video, it will become increasingly important to extract data about those videos in a form that s easy to analyze   namely, text. So as Smith demonstrated for me, Vu Digital s Video-to-Data product actually breaks down a video frame-by-frame, identifies the objects in each frame, and then creates a chronological transcript identifying things like music, dialogue, faces, logos, text and graphics. What s the point  Smith suggested this could be used by  anyone in the video value chain,  such as creators, publishers or marketers. The data could used for things like search engine optimization, personalization, ad targeting, and determining the  brand value  of a video, namely how long and how prominently a product or logo appeared. Smith admitted that the current product comes from a pivot, but a pivot that illustrates the problem Vu Digital is trying to solve. The company started out focused on web personalization, but Smith said,  We quickly found more and more website content was becoming video and we couldn t make long tail content recommendations   the tags for the video were absolutely insufficient.  So the team decided to  drop everything  and focus on the video issue. Other companies have built video analysis and search tools   in fact, Microsoft acquired its own video search company back in 2011. However, Smith said he s not aware of any competitors that can identify everything that Vu Digital can, nor can competitors do it with the product s speed.
