India startup action#1: Ola raises $310M led by DST Global; valued at $2.3B:  Ola (formerly Olacabs), has raised $310 million (Rs 1,952 crore) in its fresh round of funding led by Russian investment firm DST Global, according to VCCEdge, the data research platform of VCCircle, based on filings with Registrar of Companies. The latest deal values Ola at Rs 14,552 crore ($2.3 billion), almost four times its valuation in October when Japan s SoftBank led a $210 million funding round in the company. DST, which backed India s largest e-com venture Flipkart last year, has brought in Rs 1,153 crore ($185 million) and has picked 7.9 per cent stake, becoming the fourth-largest shareholder in the company behind SoftBank, Tiger Global and Matrix Partners. The round also saw participation from a bunch of other existing and new investors, including a few who joined in recently with the acquisition of TaxiForSure through a cash-and-stock transaction. While Ola s single-biggest shareholder SoftBank did not participate in the latest funding, its first institutional backer Tiger Global brought in $40 million to restrict equity dilution.
