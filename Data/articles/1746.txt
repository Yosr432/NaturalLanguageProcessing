Twitter Pushes Ads With A New Button Atop Mobile Users  Profiles: Twitter s latest push to monetize its service has led to the rollout of a new  Twitter Ads  button, which is now prominently appearing on user profile pages on both the iOS and Android client applications. The newly added button, which some users may have initially mistaken as a shortcut to Twitter analytics, is found right next to the  Edit profile  button, the account switcher and the Settings icon. By clicking on the Ads button, users are offered the ability to manage their Twitter ad campaigns while on the go. That s a different tactic and perhaps a more overzealous one than the one Facebook took when it introduced a way to manage Facebook ads via smartphones earlier this year. The company launched a dedicated Facebook Ads Manager App which not only allowed current advertisers to track the way their ad campaigns were performing, but actually brought the creation process itself to mobile phones. Here, users could write ad text, upload photos, and even target their desired audience right from the app itself. Not everyone is happy with the change, which some Twitter users are calling  desperate,  or  ugly.  And it s hard to find fault with those sentiments. If you re not currently running a Twitter ad campaign, the feature does nothing more than let you know that this button serves as a place where you can manage an ad campaign in the future   it doesn t go so far as to allow users to actually get started building their first campaign from the app itself.
