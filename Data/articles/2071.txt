Google earnings: $17.3B, +12% Y/Y, net income $3.6B; shares up despite earnings miss: Google on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue of $17.3 billion, up 12 percent over the same period last year. That figure was driven substantially downward by the strong dollar. Absent currency fluctuations, revenues would have been up 17 percent. Google missed Wall Street s expectations for the sixth time in the last nine quarters. Net revenue, which excludes payments to the company s advertising partners, was $13.9 billion, up from $12.2 billion. Analysts had expected net revenue of $14.04 billion, according to Bloomberg. Net income in the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $3.6 billion, or $5.20 a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or $5.04 a share. Excluding the cost of stock options and related tax benefits, Google s profit was $6.57 a share, compared with $6.27 a year ago. Analysts had expected $6.63 a share. During its first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, the search giant tried to assuage analysts  long-running concern that its growth is slowing because mobile phones, with their tiny screens that can be clumsy to click through, are a less lucrative advertising medium than the desktop computers with which the Google empire was built. In doing so, Patrick Pichette, the company s chief financial officer, who is leaving, noted that Google s YouTube video site has been growing fast but for now is simply a less lucrative business than Google s highly targeted search ads. Google shares were up about 3 percent in after-hours trading.
