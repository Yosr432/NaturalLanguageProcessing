Uber s Car-Hailing Service Banned in Germany, Court Says. A German court ordered Uber Technologies Inc. to stop its ride-hailing service in the country for profit, dealing a blow to the startup s expansion plans outside the U.S. It is anti-competitive that Uber routes requests for rides via its UberPop application to drivers  that have no legitimation according to the Passenger Transportation Act, and hence the company is instigating to break the law,  the Frankfurt regional court said in a statement Wednesday. The verdict will affect Uber s services in Frankfurt and Munich. In Dusseldorf, Berlin and Hamburg, the company has already changed its business model, cutting the fare it charges to as little as 35 euro cents (37 U.S. cents) per kilometer -- effectively turning UberPop into one of Germany s many non-profit share-a-ride services -- to evade an earlier ban issued by local authorities.  This is a setback, in particular, for all those who want more of a choice when it comes to their personal mobility,  San Francisco-based Uber said in a statement.  It is also a setback for society as a whole, because for the time being most individual transport services will remain expensive and thus not be affordable for everyone.  Uber said it would probably file an appeal. Today s ruling doesn t affect its UberBlack limousine service and uberTAXI offers.  We will not give up on the German market,  it said.
