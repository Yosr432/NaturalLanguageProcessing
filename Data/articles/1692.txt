Netflix Posts Mixed Results, but New Memberships Surge - Shares up 10% on Earnings: These are heady times for Netflix. On Wednesday, investors even looked past a 63 percent drop in second-quarter profits to send shares in Netflix surging nearly 10 percent in after-hours trading, on news that it added a record 3.3 million global streaming members during the second quarter, eclipsing expectations. There are reasons for caution. The big falloff in net income Netflix reported on Wednesday underscored the huge level of investment required to execute its strategy of pressing deeper into original programming and aggressively moving overseas. Netflix has warned investors that it doesn t expect to break even globally until the end of 2016. The company has said that it will deliver material global profits after that period of expansion. Total revenue was $1.6 billion in the second quarter, up 23 percent from the period last year.
