Despite splashy new investments and Alibaba, SoftBank is hurting from its Sprint investment: A 15 percent drop in SoftBank s shares this year suggests investors have concerns about its shorter-term prospects. The company this week reduced its annual operating profit outlook by 10 percent, citing mounting losses at Sprint. Its 80 percent ownership of Sprint is worth about $15.5 billion, less than the $22 billion SoftBank paid last year. Sprint s shares have slumped 54 percent in New York this year. After the company reported its 11th straight quarter of subscriber losses this week, the stock fell 21 percent in the last two days alone. In addition to Sprint, and the the 32% stake in Alibaba, SoftBank owns 36%  of Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) and 40% of GungHo. Those stakes are worth $8.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, according to its website.
