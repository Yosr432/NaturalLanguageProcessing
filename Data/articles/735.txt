Tech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock: For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers. In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street. Now that attitude may be changing. As LinkedIn prepares to report its latest quarterly earnings next week, Wall Street is increasingly scrutinizing the number of stock grants that the company pays employees   especially after LinkedIn projected lower growth for this year and its stock price has fallen. The Silicon Valley company s stock-based compensation  provides additional reason to remain cautious  on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note. The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies. Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company s operating results that exclude that expense. Yet public tech companies have had a rockier time in the stock market this year. That has led investors to begin looking more closely at the quality of the companies  financial results. The scrutiny means examining earnings with stock-based compensation expenses included   and certain financial measures, like earnings and margins, invariably look worse when that expense is factored in.
