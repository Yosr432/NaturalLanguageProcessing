Okta Is Now a Unicorn After $75 Million Funding Round. Okta, the startup that helps companies manage their sign-in information for hundreds of cloud services and business software applications, has landed a $75 million round of funding at an implied valuation of $1.2 billion. The investment is coming from existing investors, including the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital. Total capital raised is now $230 million. It has been about 15 months since Okta last raised money. Last year it took a $75 million round led by Sequoia that valued the company at about $600 million. Sequoia is a significant investor, having also led Okta s D round in 2013 and its C round in 2012. Okta is also notable for being Andreessen Horowitz s first investment in the cloud software area back in 2010 when the firm led its A round. Since then the company has expanded into new lines of business, including helping companies manage their mobile devices.
