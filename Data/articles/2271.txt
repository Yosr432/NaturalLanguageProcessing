How Alibaba's U.S. IPO Got the Company Ordered Out of Taiwan: Documents give government evidence it needs to make the Chinese connection. Taiwan wants to kick Alibaba.com out because it's Chinese. Of course, everybody has known since its inception that Alibaba, the world's largest e-commerce operator, is Chinese. What's operating in Taiwan, however, is Alibaba.com Singapore E-Commerce Private Ltd. When that company was registered on April 9, 2008, Jack Ma's outfit was doing what it does in many countries, and indeed what many corporations do in many countries: operating via an offshore holding company. But in Taiwan, the difference between being Singaporean and Chinese is as stark as night and day. If your company is from Singapore, the U.S., Japan or just about anywhere, then Taiwan is open for business. If you're from mainland China: not so much. Then Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. filed for its record-breaking U.S. IPO. While Yahoo! Inc., Singapore's Temasek Holdings, Ma and everyone else got rich, Taiwan got a nice little present too. The hundreds of pages of pre-IPO documents, such as Alibaba's prospectus, contained the information Taiwan's investment commission needed to prove what it already thought it knew, Chang said. So now that it has evidence of the alleged Chineseness, it's ordered Alibaba out by the end of August. They could either sell the business or close it, Chang said. Alibaba though, doesn't appear ready to walk away. Taiwan is an important market, Ma told reporters in Taipei later the same day. It complied with the law when it entered, and complies with local laws wherever it goes, he said. "We will actively communicate with related parties to clarify the issues and, if necessary, will take proper actions to protect the legitimate interests of Alibaba.com," the company said in a statement.
