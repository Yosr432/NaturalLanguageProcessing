More on the same: Its stock trailing peers, Google looks to Wall Street for CFO as costs, cash grow: Google Inc. is turning to Wall Street for its next chief financial officer as the technology giant grapples with rising costs, a growing pile of cash and a need for fiscal discipline as it invests in new industries. Ruth Porat, 57, will leave Morgan Stanley in April after more than 25 years there, the New York-based company said Tuesday in a memo to employees. Jonathan Pruzan, 46, Morgan Stanley s co-head of global financial-institutions banking, will become the company s new finance chief. At Google, Porat will succeed Patrick Pichette, who announced earlier this month that he would retire. She is set to take her new post on May 26. Investors are looking for Porat, one of the financial industry s most senior female executives, to apply her financial acumen as Google invests to spur growth amid increased competition from Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. She follows other financial-services veterans who have migrated to Silicon Valley firms, such as social-media service Twitter Inc., payments-provider Square Inc. and messaging startup Snapchat Inc.  A dose of increased discipline could certainly serve Google well,  said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners LP.  The key to this job is going to be the person that rationalizes the expenses of the company. Google is full of people who want to pursue big ideas.  Google s net income climbed 41 percent in its latest quarter from a year earlier, while Facebook s increased 34 percent and Apple s rose 38 percent. Google s shares have lagged behind its rivals, dropping 0.3 percent in the year through Tuesday. Facebook s shares meanwhile rose 33 percent, while Apple s increased 64 percent. Google s shares rose 2.2 percent to close at $577.54 on Tuesday.
