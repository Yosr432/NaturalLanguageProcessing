Uber resumes payments through credit card in India: Beginning today, ride sharing app Uber Technologies Inc has resumed accepting credit card payments in India. Uber s app has been tweaked for the two-factor authentication (2FA) flow that the Reserve Bank of India mandates for all card-based payments, the company said in a press statement. This feature is available to all Android users immediately and will be extended on the iOS platform in the coming weeks. Uber had stopped accepting payments through credit cards (issued in India) and debit cards seven months ago after it was pulled up by the RBI. As a safety measure, RBI requires all credit and debit card transactions to undergo a two-step process for honouring payments. Typically, a user swipes or enters the credit/debit card information in the first step and then has to enter a password in the second step. Uber followed only one-step authentication and directly billed users at the end of the ride, which fell foul of RBI rules. The San Francisco-based company had tied up with mobile wallet firm Paytm to sidestep the 2FA compliance requirement. Uber will continue to accept Paytm payments, it said.
