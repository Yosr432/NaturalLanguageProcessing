Netflix Goes Live in 130 New Countries Including India - But China Skipped; Shares Advance: Netflix Inc. began selling its streaming service in India and more than 100 other countries, closing in on its goal of becoming the first global online television service. The stock logged its biggest gain since July, surging 9.3 percent. Netflix went live in 130 new countries, including Russia, Poland and Singapore, during his presentation. Adding India, most of the rest of Asia and other countries around the world marks a major step for Netflix. But China, the world s most populous country, remains a gap. The company faces challenges in China, where a local partnership is essential given government controls over licensing for online content, and many potential allies already have competing businesses. Alibaba recently acquired full control of Youku Tudou, one of the largest video streaming services in the country, while Baidu and Tencent own popular video services.
