Twitter Opens Up Its Amplify Video Ad Program: Twitter just announced an expansion of its Amplify ad program that should make it accessible to more publishers and advertisers. Amplify is the company s two-year-old program for video ads. Initially, it involved a direct and somewhat complicated relationship   the publisher would embed a short video clip in a tweet, then the advertiser would both include a short pre-roll ad in the tweet and pay to promote the tweet in Twitter. In the new, open version of Amplify, an advertiser no longer needs to work with a specific publisher. Instead, they choose a content category, then Twitter will automatically include their pre-roll ads in videos tweeted by relevant publishers. (Advertisers can also use Twitter s other ad targeting capabilities at the same time.) This isn t just about making the process easier for advertisers   it also gives publishers a monetary incentive to share their video clips on Twitter. We ve heard that the revenue split is 70 percent for publishers and 30 percent for Twitter, and that publishers will be able to blacklist certain advertisers or categories if they feel like they re not a good fit.
