Coupang, Korea's Amazon" raises USD 300M, valuation > USD 1B, GMV runrate USD 2.2B: Coupang, a fast-growing e-commerce company in South Korea, has raised $300 million of additional financing to aid its expansion plans. While Bom Kim, the chief executive, declined to disclose the company s valuation, he said it was higher than the roughly $1 billion price tag the company achieved in its previous financing round. He also said the company now had about $500 million of cash in the bank. Coupang, based in Seoul, calls itself the Amazon of Korea. In addition to selling its own inventory, the company allows third-party merchants to sell through its site. While it competes in Korea with eBay and a site called 11th Street, Coupang says its competitive edge stems from its focus on ordering through mobile devices and from its delivery network. Like Amazon, Coupang has built its own warehouses, called fulfillment centers. But it has gone a step beyond Amazon by also employing its own delivery workers, whom it calls  Coupang men.  (Mr. Kim said the fleet includes some women as well.) These workers, who try to build relationships with customers by doing things like leaving handwritten notes, can often deliver packages on the day they are ordered. Mr. Kim, 36, who started Coupang in late 2010 after dropping out of Harvard Business School, said the company was now generating gross sales   the total value of goods passing through the site   of $2.2 billion on an annualized basis. He said roughly one in three people in South Korea had downloaded the company s app.
