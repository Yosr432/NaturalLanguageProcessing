Walmart has been quietly building up its own ad network and apps for comparison shopping: Walmart Exchange WMX is a platform available to brands that sell products at Walmart. Agencies buying ads for Walmart s brands can use the tool to serve online ads in real-time based on shopper data, promising SKU-level measurement for marketers. Walmart s media agency MediaVest also has access to WMX to manage its digital media buys on behalf of the retailer. Since launching, Monahan said that WMX is rolling out new features weekly that track the performance of campaigns. Meanwhile, @WalmartLabs is credited for cranking out mobile apps, e-commerce and social tools for shoppers. Just this year, it has rolled out a new e-commerce site, an app revamp that pulls in local inventory and a program called Savings Catcher. Savings Catcher is an app that scans a receipt to find prices at competing stores. If the app finds a cheaper price, shoppers get money back in the form of a gift card.
