Facebook to Test Emoji as Reaction Icons: Despite the billions of  likes  bestowed on Facebook posts every month, something has been missing: an option to express a different emotion. On Thursday, Facebook announced it will begin testing six new emotional reactions that you can convey with a simple emoji, similar to the thumbs-up  like  icon that the social networking service has made so famous. The six new emoji depict various expressions, from an open mouth to express surprise to a scowling red face for anger. The other four emotions are love, laughter, sadness and a supportive cheer. The new reaction icons will be available to most Facebook users in Spain and Ireland by the end of this week. Adam Mosseri, who oversees Facebook s news feed, said the company would evaluate how people in those two countries use the new buttons and refine them, before expanding the rollout to the company s 1.5 billion users worldwide later this year.
