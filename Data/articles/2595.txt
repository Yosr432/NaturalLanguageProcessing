YouTube also faces a host of small rivals - startups like Interlude that are gaining traction: The basic format of Interlude s videos will be familiar to anyone who grew up on the  Choose Your Own Adventure  book series. As the film plays, a viewer is prompted with questions about how to proceed   wear the black dress or the white one    and the video seamlessly integrates each choice. The company is one of many challenging YouTube s dominance of online video. Vessel, started by two former Hulu executives, recently revealed a plan to offer $3 subscriptions for early access to short videos. And in September, the Universal Music Group made a deal with Mirriad, a company that specializes in inserting new ads into old videos. Interlude s success against a giant like YouTube   which is owned by Google and attracts more than a billion viewers each month   is by no means guaranteed. But it has already had some promising hits. more engaged audience yields higher ad rates, and Interlude s narrative mazes also offer ways for producers to incorporate brands (for a fee, of course). In one illustration cited by Robert S. Wiesenthal, Warner Music s chief operating officer, the viewer of a rap video could choose to have the star keep dancing at a party or hop into a BMW.  We are all on this hunt for monetization,  Mr. Wiesenthal said.  When someone makes a choice to learn about something, that is worth more than, say, a passive pre-roll ad or a guy just holding a bottle of Scotch in his hands.
