After a quiet summer, Twitter s board will take a hard look at what comes next: Twitter s quiet summer may soon be coming to an end. The social communication company s board of directors is set to meet this Thursday in San Francisco, and there are plenty of things to discuss. That includes, said sources, its fate as a standalone company. That s no surprise, since Twitter has been the subject of numerous takeover and acquisition rumors over the last few months, each one sending the stock up as investors hold out hope that Twitter will find a buyer. There are the big corporate names that might take another close look at Twitter, such as Google (there s an unusual scenario one source mentioned in which it becomes part of some Alphabet media spinoff), Apple and even media mogul Rupert Murdoch, either via 21st Century Fox or News Corp. Other possible bidders include private equity firms that may want to take the company private, where it can solve some of its issues out of the public eye. But finding a buyer won t be easy, given the Twitter s estimated cost. Using the same multiple LinkedIn got from Microsoft in its recent $26 billion acquisition deal, a Twitter buyer would have to fork over about $18 billion. That s a steep price tag for a company that has had persistent issues with growth and also one that is still losing money each quarter.
