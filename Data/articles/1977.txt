PayPal to Trade Under Old Symbol PYPL After Split From EBay: PayPal, the payments division that s separating from EBay Inc., will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market as PYPL, its original ticker symbol before being acquired by the online marketplace in 2002. EBay announced the split last year after activist investor Carl Icahn said PayPal was being held back by its parent company s slower-growing Web marketplace business. All of EBay Inc. s 15 board members will remain with the company or become new board members of PayPal when it spins off from EBay in the third quarter. EBay Chairman Pierre Omidyar, who founded the online marketplace in 1995, will be a director for both companies, EBay said Thursday in a statement.
