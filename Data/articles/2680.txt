Tumblr Overtakes Instagram As Fastest-Growing Social Platform, Snapchat Is The Fastest-Growing App; Facebook saturated: While Tumblr and Pinterest appear to have seen the most growth, they are not seeing as much use when it comes to frequency, where the numbers almost appear to invert. With 1.35 billion active monthly users, Facebook continues to be the world s largest social network by some margin, but  when it comes to picking up new users, it appears to have reached a saturation point. Research out today from the Global Web Index notes that Tumblr s active user base in the last six months grew by 120%, while Facebook s grew by only 2%.  And in overall member growth, Pinterest took the lead with 57% growth while Facebook s member base grew by 6%. In mobile apps specifically, while Facebook is the largest app today, Snapchat   with an emphasis on teen and 20-something users   is the fastest growing of them all, up 56% this year. It is however followed closely by Facebook Messenger and Instagram   a sign of not just how Facebook s mobile apps continue to represent the company s growth drivers, but also how its push to drive more users to the standalone app by cutting out Messaging from the main app has helped it grow. China continues to be dominated by home-grown social networks. Sina Weibo, Qzone and Tencent Weibo lead, while Youku and Tudou round out the top 5.
