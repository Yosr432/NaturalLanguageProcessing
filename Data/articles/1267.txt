With Instagram s Boomerang, making gifs is easier than ever: It s a gif world, and we re just living in it. Those short, looping (often loopy) animated files pop up just about everywhere on the Web and in social media. Now, it s easier than ever to make them yourself. Instagram s new app, Boomerang, makes it very easy to make your own 1-second gifs for sharing on Instagram, Facebook and your phone s camera roll. The process couldn t be simpler. Just find something moving that you want to shoot, hit the capture button and keep as still as you can for a second or so. You can shoot from either rear-facing or front-facing camera. To work, the app will need permission to access those cameras, as well as your phone s storage. Free, for iOS and Android.
