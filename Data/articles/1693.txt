Intel Earnings Surpass Forecasts, Driven by Data Centers: Overall for the second quarter, Intel reported net income of $2.7 billion, or 55 cents a share. That was down $100 million from a year earlier, but was the same in per-share terms because Intel has bought back a lot of its stock. Net income was also lifted by a lower tax rate. Revenue fell 5 percent, to $13.2 billion. Intel has been working on making a new future for itself by investing more in chips for data centers and Internet-connected products for industry   and some of those investments are paying off. Sales of chips for data centers rose 10 percent from a year earlier. In total, data center, Internet of Things and high-level memory chip sales were 40 percent of revenue and 70 percent of profits. Intel reported on Wednesday that second-quarter revenue from chips for PCs fell 14 percent.
