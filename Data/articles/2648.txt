Uber raises $1.2B of new funding, valuation of $40B (>Tesla, 4x of AirBnb) also raises $1B convertible debt (with hint of IPO less than 4 years away): Uber closed a new $1.2 billion round of financing on Thursday, with investors valuing the company at a staggering $40 billion. That puts a new mountain of cash on top of the $1.5 billion that Uber had already raised. The company is now valued at four times that of other elite Silicon Valley startups, such as Airbnb Inc. Uber s value also dwarfs Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA), which has a market capitalization of $28.6 billion. General Motors Co., the largest U.S. automaker, has a $53.2 billion market capitalization. Uber is also building its finances with a more than $1 billion convertible debt sale to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) s wealth management clients. The clients are getting a chance to buy a six-year bond in Uber that will convert into equity at a 20 percent to 30 percent discount to the company s valuation at the time of an initial public offering, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Goldman Sachs isn t investing its own money in the debt, said the people. The convertible bond carries a coupon that increases over time if Uber hasn t gone public within 4 years, said the people.  It s interesting that, with the convertible debt, Uber is putting itself under pressure to go public within 4 years,  Sanwal said.
