AWS results will be broken out separately going forward; AWS will continue to dominate capex: One question investors always have about Amazon will soon be solved. The company said it would start breaking out numbers for its cloud computing platform, AWS, after the current quarter. AWS is growing much faster than Amazon as a whole, although price wars with other leading players are presumably cutting into profitability. Revenue in the  other  category, which is dominated by AWS, was $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, up 41 percent. AWS is likely Amazon's most profitable division, some opine: Still, the shift is a good sign for investors, who have been clamoring for Amazon to disclose more about its fastest-growing and likely most profitable division that some analysts say accounts for 4 percent of total sales. The change seemed unlikely until AWS made up 10 percent of Amazon's net sales, the threshold at which U.S. securities regulators require disclosure. Szkutak also added that a large portion of Amazon's capital expenditure will go toward AWS, which has stepped up its efforts to win over lucrative contracts with large, corporate clients.
