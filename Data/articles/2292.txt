Quantity and value of data is an overlooked benefit to delaying an IPO: It s taking longer for startups to get to IPO, but that s not necessarily bad news for investors in private companies. Why  Because startups today aren t just valuable for their future exit potential, but for the proprietary data they produce while still private. Market statistics clearly show companies are staying private longer. The average time to IPO has doubled to nine years today from four in 1999, and the median amount raised prior to IPO has increased steadily from $48 million in 2008 to $101 million in 2013. Of the 100 largest VC rounds in history, 90 have occurred in the last five years. There are several reasons startups are staying private longer, including volatile public markets, healthy secondary markets, and a preference by some for mega-M&As. Whatever the reason startups don t seek IPOs early, there is a real and often overlooked benefit to investors when startups stay private longer   the value of their data.
