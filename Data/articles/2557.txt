'While you were away' - Twitter's recap feature is rolling out to significant numbers of users:  While you were away  works much like Facebook s Timeline and is the first major non-chronological feature to hit Twitter. Back in November, the company said it would look at the  best  tweets from your network since you last opened Twitter, and put them at the top of your timeline so you don t miss them. The algorithm that Twitter uses to source your  best  tweets from your friends is crucial to its success. As someone who doesn t use Twitter every minute of every day, I d appreciate a recap but only if it is able to surface content that is relevant and interesting to me. There are already some services that exist solely to do that, while Twitter has email alerts for the purpose too. Nuzzel, for example, taps into your Facebook and Twitter network to surface news stories and other items that are popular with people you know. I m skeptical that Twitter s feature can be as effective, particularly since it only serves up a single tweet and that takes up precious real-estate at the top of your feed. Nonetheless, the addition looks like it will be more useful for users than many of Twitter s recent features   which include sponsored accounts appearing in following lists, tweets from people you don t follow in your timeline, and a test that meddled with the retweet button.
