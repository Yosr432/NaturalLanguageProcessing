Twitter completes one - not very successful - year as a public company tomorrow: Twitter Inc. (TWTR) is celebrating its one-year anniversary as a public company tomorrow with a stock that s soared 55 percent from its debut. Its performance by many other measures is less stellar. After jumping 73 percent to open at $45.10 on its first trading day, Twitter s share price today is lower at $40.37, and the company currently has a record-low enterprise value of 19.4 times trailing 12-month sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The San Francisco-based company also continues to bleed money, with losses widening faster than sales gains. Twitter s profitability has been pushed out to 2017 from 2015 at the time of its initial public offering, according to analysts  estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The data underline how Twitter has fallen short as the rocket-ship growth stock it billed itself as during the run-up to last November s IPO. The microblogging service touted its global reach and potential during its pitch to investors, asking them to focus on monthly user numbers that ended up slowing. Now Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo is dealing with the backlash, even as the company s digital-advertising business booms. The disconnect between what people thought would happen with Twitter s trajectory and what actually happened make this one of the bigger  misfires  in technology stocks, said Francis Gaskins, research director at financial-media site Equities.com.  It s been a round-trip ticket.  Jim Prosser, a spokesman at Twitter, declined to comment. Twitter went public last Nov. 6 at $26 a share.
