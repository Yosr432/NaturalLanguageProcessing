Twitter to Eliminate 140-Character Limit in Direct Messages Twitter Inc., the home of 140-character messages, is removing the space limit in its private messages. The change comes next month, the San Francisco-based company said Thursday on its website for developers. Direct Messages are different from tweets in that they are only visible between individual users.  We ve done a lot to improve Direct Messages over the past year and have much more exciting work on the horizon,  Sachin Agarwal, Twitter s product manager for Direct Message, wrote.  You may be wondering what this means for the public side of Twitter. Nothing! Tweets will continue to be the 140 characters they are today.
