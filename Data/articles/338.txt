Apple will not give first-weekend sales of iPhone 7, the company said on Thursday, making it harder for analysts to get a read on the product's prospects amid questions over whether its popularity has peaked. The company decided to stop the practice because the number of phones sold during the period has become more a reflection of Apple s supply than demand, a company spokeswoman said, when asked whether Apple will be releasing the figure.The stakes for the iPhone 7 are high after sales of the gadget dropped during two straight quarters this year, the first declines in its history. As they try to assess whether the iPhone has reached a plateau, investors will not be happy about losing a data point, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. "Less data is never good, particularly given the question marks around this phone," he said. Apple shares fell 2.4 percent to $105.71 in mid-day trading.
