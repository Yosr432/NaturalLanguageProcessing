Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, revealed a new name for the company s Life Sciences division: Verily. Alphabet made the branding announcement with a video and a company website that went live on Monday. In it, Verily laid out a multidisciplinary approach to health and longevity, describing disease as a  continuum  that will be fought with experts from different fields and divisions working on hardware such as medical devices, software that might use algorithms to look for health patterns, as well as clinical studies like the Baseline Study of health and disease. The new name for the business is part of Google s transition to a holding company structure under the parent entity dubbed Alphabet. For those keeping track of Alphabet s soup of operating companies, Verily is the division that was the Life Sciences unit of Google s X lab. Life Sciences  graduated  from Google X shortly after Google announced the Alphabet structure. Verily means  truth  or  truly  and the name, according to the spokeswoman, is meant to underscore the company s mission to reveal a true picture of health and disease.  Background: For years, Google has been entering new businesses, but struggling to recreate the success it enjoys in search and advertising. In August, Google announced that it would create a new org structure where its traditional businesses (search, advertising, YouTube, maps) would continue to be called Google, while all other businesses would become separate companies. The parent of all of these companies would be called Alphabet. The idea is that the new businesses would get more room to grow and innovate like startups, while the traditional businesses would get higher stock market valuations because of their incredible profitability and size.
