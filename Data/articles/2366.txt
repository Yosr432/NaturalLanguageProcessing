Facebook edges towards eCommerce; ad giant makes it easier for members to sell: Facebook on Tuesday announced the addition of a new feature for Facebook Groups designed to make it easier for members of a  For Sale  group to list their items. The new  Sell  feature, which is now starting to roll out globally to more groups, will allow members to create a post where you can add a description of the item for sale, set a price and set a pick-up or delivery location. The social network today already hosts tens of millions of groups based around a variety of interests, and  For Sale  groups are one of the most popular categories. In these groups, members use Facebook as an alternative to something like Craigslist for local selling, or as an alternative to eBay for selling collectibles or other items of broad interest, like books or electronics. Currently, members in these  For Sale  groups generally post photos and text descriptions of their items, but the addition of the  Sell  feature will make filling out the necessary information a bit more structured than before.
