Microsoft's Q3 earnings (rev $23B, 25% Y/Y, net income $4.5B) were everything that Amazon's were not: Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact. The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master. Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36. the company said its net income was $4.54 billion, or 54 cents a share, compared with $5.24 billion, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was $23.20 billion, up from $18.53 billion
