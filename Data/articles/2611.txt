Amazon India launches jewelry sales; separately an auto-repricing bug drops some prices on Amazon UK to a penny, shocking some sellers: A groups of British Amazon.co.uk sellers were shocked last week to find their goods had gotten an unexpected and drastic price cut -- to just a penny. Although Amazon and other retailers do occasionally run promotions where things only cost one cent, this glitch was the fault of non-Amazon software from RepricerExpress, which automatically reprices items online. The problem only lasted for about an hour, but it came during peak shopping time ahead of Christmas, at a time when many customers are looking to online shopping to get last-minute gifts to their destinations on time. And, according to Britain's Sky News, some retailers say the glitch cost them tens of thousands of dollars, and may even put some of them out of business. Repricing software is commonly used by retailers and individuals who regularly sell items on Amazon and other online marketplaces. These automated tools are used by sellers across the globe to send prices down (or up) depending on market demand. The company, which claims to support over 2,000 sellers on Amazon and Raukten.com, has apologized for the error and said it's looking to "put measures in place" to keep the mistake from happening again. As of Monday, the company said, systems were running normally. Most affected orders were canceled. In a statement, Amazon said it's working to remedy the few orders that were processed and will be reaching out to sellers on its own.
