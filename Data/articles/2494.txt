Google will stop selling Glass to the general public - but Google says the device is not dead yet. (More coverage here) A report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday said Google will stop selling Glass to the general public Jan. 19.  The company confirmed the report and said Google will still give Glass units to developers and companies who want to look at its applications for the office as part of Google's "Glass at Work" program, which has examined how the headset can help professionals such as doctors, emergency workers and filmmakers. On the consumer front, the company has been pretty quiet about Glass in recent months, a striking contrast to its splashy 2012 launch, when Google chief executive Sergey Brin unveiled the device by skydiving into the company's developers conference. At first it was only available to developers, dubbed "Explorers" by the company, who wanted to play around with the new technology. Over the next year, Google tried to make the device more marketable to the general public by introducing. high-fashion frames, sunglasses lenses and prescription lenses for Glass. But the idea of a face-worn computer still met with skepticism, ridicule and even hostility from the general public. It also drew several comparisons to notable tech flops such as the Segway as a product that started with a good idea but was ultimately too niche -- and, honestly, too nerdy -- to catch on outside a group of dedicated enthusiasts. Despite originally hinting that it would launch a consumer version of Glass by the end of 2014, Google never did -- though the company did eventually let anyone with $1,500 buy their own developer version.
