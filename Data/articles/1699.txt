Meet Miip, the Ad Monkey in Your App, From InMobi: Naveen Tewari, chief executive of InMobi, thinks the 1.2 billion people who see ads served by his company s mobile ad network are tired of being bombarded with generally irrelevant marketing messages. He says advertising should be friendly, more tour guide than tout, and help people discover new products and services that they actually want to buy. To test that proposition, InMobi has developed Miip, an animated monkey character that follows you from app to app, watches what you re doing and suggests products that you might want to buy. The Indian company unveiled the technology at an event in San Francisco on Tuesday evening. The idea is that instead of seeing a regular ad in your app, Miip would appear, with a text bubble inviting you to check out products from advertisers that it thinks are relevant. If you re playing classic rock on an app like Spotify, for example, Miip might suggest a Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd T-shirt and offer you the option to buy it right from the app. Over time, if the monkey makes smart suggestions, the company hopes, you will be more inclined to click on it when you see it pop up in other apps and perhaps even take the time to tell it what kinds of things you most want to see. InMobi has been quietly testing Miip (pronounced Meep) for six months, trying it with about 5 million users. Early advertisers include the streaming music service Spotify, the travel agents Expedia and Orbitz, niche retailers like Joyus and TheRealReal, and several major American retailers that weren t willing to publicly disclose their involvement. The Miip ads will begin appearing in 40,000 apps on Wednesday, and InMobi hopes to eventually convert most of the 200 million ads served by its network each month to the format.
