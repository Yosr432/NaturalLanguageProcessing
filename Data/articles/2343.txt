China s internet restrictions are hurting business, survey finds:  Foreign businesspeople in China are increasingly frustrated by the growing obstacles to wide Internet access, including the onerous system of censorship known as the Great Firewall, according to survey results released this week by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The survey was answered by 106 companies that are based in the European Union and have offices in China. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said their businesses had been negatively affected by the blocking of certain websites or tools. That was an increase from 71 percent in last year s survey. The chamber also asked its members about the greater tightening of Internet access that occurred in China at the end of 2014 and this year. Eighty percent reported a worsening impact on business. Starting in late 2014, the Chinese government cut off access to Gmail from third-party apps, forcing people in China to rely on virtual private network, or V.P.N., software to get to Google s email service. The regular Gmail site and other Google pages had been blocked consistently since last summer, but people in China had been able to use third-party apps to download Gmail to their devices until December. After blocking Gmail downloads through those apps, forcing more people to turn to VPN software, the government went on to aggressively attack V.P.N. s. The chamber found that 13 percent of survey respondents had recently deferred investing more in research and development in China, or had been unwilling to set up those operations here, since restrictions grew at the beginning of the year.
