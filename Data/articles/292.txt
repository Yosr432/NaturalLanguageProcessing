Meitu Makes Muted Debut in H.K. s Biggest Tech IPO Since 2007: Chinese selfie-apps developer Meitu Inc. stood little changed from its offer price Thursday, a less-than-stellar debut for the biggest initial public offering since the start of a program that made it easier for mainland investors to buy and sell stocks in Hong Kong. Meitu s IPO was also the biggest coming-out party for a tech company since 2007, when Alibaba.com Ltd. listed. Its shares stood at HK$8.50 at 9:49 a.m. local time, unchanged from an offer price that was already at the bottom of a marketed range. Meitu now has a valuation of HK$35.9 billion ($4.6 billion). The company, which runs apps including Meitu, Meipai and BeautyPlus, is ratcheting up a presence in overseas markets to lure more people beyond the existing 456 million monthly active users. Beauty Plus currently has more than 160 million users including in Japan, Indonesia and India. It will develop more localized features for people in the U.S., including tools that make people look tanned in their photos, said Cai.
