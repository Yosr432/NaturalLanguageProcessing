Spotify seeks to raise $500M at $6-7B valuation, delay IPO: Spotify, the popular streaming music service, has retained Goldman Sachs to raise $500 million in private investment, a move that would probably delay the possibility of an initial public stock offering in the near future.As a result of this latest round of investment, Spotify s valuation would increase to at least $6 billion, and possibly $7 billion or more, according to a person briefed on the company s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In its last fund-raising round, in late 2013, it took in $250 million and was valued at more than $4 billion. Spotify says it now has 60 million users around the world, 15 million of whom pay. On Wednesday, it scored a coup in the digital music market when Sony said it would soon shut Music Unlimited, its failed streaming outlet, and replace it with Spotify.
