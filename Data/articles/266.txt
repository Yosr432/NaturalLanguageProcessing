How Russia Recruited Elite Hackers for Its Cyberwar: For more than three years, rather than rely on military officers working out of isolated bunkers, Russian government recruiters have scouted a wide range of programmers, placing prominent ads on social media sites, offering jobs to college students and professional coders, and even speaking openly about looking in Russia s criminal underworld for potential talent. In Russia, recruiters have looked well beyond the nation s school system. Those recruits were intended to cycle through military contracting companies and newly formed units called science squadrons established on military bases around the country. As early as 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a  head hunt in the positive meaning of the word  for coders. In 2013, as Russia s recruitment drive was picking up, Dmitry A. Artimovich, a soft-spoken physicist, was awaiting trial in a Moscow jail for designing a computer program that spammed email users with advertisements for male sexual enhancement products. One day a cellmate, who had been convicted of selling narcotics online, sidled up to him with some news. The cellmate said that people incarcerated for cybercrimes could get out before trial, in exchange for working for the government. Another inmate had already taken a deal, he said.  It was an offer to cooperate,  Mr. Artimovich said.  Why else would you work for the government   he added.  The salaries are tiny. But if you do something illegal, and go to prison for eight or nine years, the F.S.B. can help you,  he said, using a Russian abbreviation for the Federal Security Service.
