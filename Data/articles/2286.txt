IRCTC ties up with Amazon to monetize traffic by selling products online: Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), a subsidiary of the government controlled Indian Railways, has now tied up with Amazon to sell products online. Last year Techcircle.in had reported that IRCTC was in talks with Amazon and Flipkart for a tie-up. In his previous conversation with Techcircle.in, a senior railway official had told that this move will leverage the site s huge database of over 21 million registered users and convert them into potential customers for third party e-commerce players and in turn act as an additional source of revenue through a fee or other mechanism for IRCTC. IRCTC handles the catering, tourism and online ticketing operations of the Indian Railways. It is the sole seller of railway tickets even though other OTAs come across as additional sales channel for booking in association with IRCTC. Under the agreement, IRCTC will leverage the huge traffic it generates being a virtual monopoly for train e-ticketing to sell products such as consumer electronic, books, shoes, apparel etc. It has added a  shop on Amazon  tab on its homepage which redirects to a separate landing page on Amazon.in.
