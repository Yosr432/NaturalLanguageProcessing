Microsoft seeks to re-invent itself: has suddenly gotten serious with mobile. This is the same Microsoft that spent almost a half-decade trying to offer a credible alternative to Apple s iPhone and mobile devices running Google s Android. And it s the same Microsoft that paid more than $7 billion to buy Nokia s once-mighty handset business, only to see its mobile business sink further. The company now clings precariously to a 3 percent share of new smartphone sales. Make no mistake, Microsoft still wants its mobile operating system, Windows, to be the software in our smartphones. But mobile developers continue to focus on making apps for Apple or Android devices instead, making Windows phones an increasingly hard sell. That reality has finally sunk in at Microsoft, and a new strategy is afoot. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft s chief executive, took the top job at the company about a year ago, he signaled that the company s priorities were shifting. Microsoft, he said, was in a  mobile-first, cloud-first world.  Since then, the company has brought more of its apps and services to the Apple and Android devices people actually use, rather than the ones Microsoft would like them to use   those that run Windows. What s even more surprising is that Microsoft s heart seems to be in the effort. Over the last several months, Microsoft has been taking up more and more space on my own iPhone s home screen. I ve installed mobile versions of its Office apps as well as OneDrive, the company s answer to Dropbox, Google Drive and other cloud storage services.
