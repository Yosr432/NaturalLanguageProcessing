Quirky, an Invention Start-Up, Files for Bankruptcy:  Quirky, an ambitious crowdsourced invention start-up, which raised $185 million from investors that included General Electric and leading venture capital firms, filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday. The failure of the company, based in New York, will surely raise questions about how far the crowd-based model of innovation and product development, made possible by the Internet, can go. Other companies are using crowdsourcing to make physical goods, from Threadless for T-shirt designs to Local Motors for automobiles. None, though, were doing it as broadly and across as wide a range of products as Quirky. The company said on Tuesday that it was seeking protection from its creditors while it arranged a sale of  substantially all its assets.  Quirky said that it already had an initial bid of $15 million for its Wink subsidiary, which was created last year. Wink makes software so that an array of Internet-connected home devices, as varied as thermostats and door locks, can be controlled from a smartphone app. Quirky had some success, with revenue rising sharply last year to about $100 million. But the scale of its ambitions   managing a sprawling community of inventors, transforming raw ideas into product designs, and orchestrating manufacturing and distribution   proved daunting and too costly.
