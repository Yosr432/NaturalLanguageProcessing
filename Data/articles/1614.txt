Google, Amazon Show Investors Cost Control Is Key for Tech: Investors have started to reward Internet companies that can show both financial discipline and a path to long-term growth, making Amazon and Google the clear winners of the technology earnings season. Google kept costs in check in the second quarter, and shareholders cheered with a 16 percent stock gain after the search giant released better-than-expected results. Amazon also surged after posting a surprise profit, demonstrating that the Web retailer is capable of making money when it puts a brake on spending. By contrast, Facebook , which vowed to keep its brisk pace of investments to lure users and advertisers, fell as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg was short on details about money-making plans for the company s newer initiatives, like WhatsApp and Oculus. LinkedIn and Twitter slumped over concerns that user growth is slowing. Microsoft Corp. posted its largest-ever quarterly loss. And Apple failed to meet analysts  predictions for iPhone sales and growth for the current quarter.
