Targeted ads to drive mobile video business, Verizon CFO says: Verizon Communications Inc 's upcoming mobile video service will drive revenue with a combination of highly targeted ads, exclusive content and pay-per-view live concerts and sporting events, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview on Tuesday. Most Americans own a mobile phone and Verizon is looking at offering video content to increase data consumption on mobile devices and grow revenue. The digital video service, which it expects to release this summer, is aimed at families and younger viewers who increasingly view content on mobile devices. The video service will be offered through a mobile app, and will include some free sponsored content, Shammo said.
