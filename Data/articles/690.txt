Icahn: We're out of Apple, and it's China's fault: Billionaire investor Carl Icahn told CNBC on Thursday he has sold hisApple position as the tech giant's stock continues to shed value after disappointing earnings. "We no longer have a position in Apple," Icahn told CNBC's "Power Lunch," noting Apple is a "great company" and CEO Tim Cook is "doing a great job." Icahn previously owned a little less than a percent of the tech giant's outstanding shares, which were down more than 3 percent midafternoon Thursday after falling more than 6 percent Wednesday. He said he made roughly $2 billion on Apple, a stock he continued to tout as "cheap" despite his reservations.Icahn said China's attitude toward Apple largely drove him to exit his position. "You worry a little bit   and maybe more than a little   about China's attitude," Icahn said, later adding that China's government could "come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... you can do pretty much what you want there." He added, though, that if China "was basically steadied," he would buy back into Apple.
