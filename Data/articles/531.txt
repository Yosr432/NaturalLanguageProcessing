Wal-Mart to Buy 5% Stake in JD.com as Part of Chinese Deal: Wal-Mart Stores will acquire a 5 percent stake in Asian e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. in a deal that will reshape the U.S. retail chain s operations in China. As part of the agreement, JD.com will take ownership of Wal-Mart s Yihaodian online marketplace, the companies said in a statement Monday. The Chinese branch of Sam s Club also will open a store on JD.com, and the two companies will link up their supply chains. The partnership gives Wal-Mart a fresh start in China after it struggled to adapt to a slowing local economy and a rise in online shopping. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has said that the company needs to succeed in China, where it estimates that 25 percent of global retail growth will come from in the next five years.A 5 percent stake in JD.com would be worth about $1.5 billion at its current stock price. Wal-Mart will receive about 145 million newly issued Class A shares of JD.com in the transaction. That deal will increase the retailer s earnings per share by 16 to 19 cents in the second quarter, according to the statement.
