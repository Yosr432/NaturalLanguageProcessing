Why Tech Support Is (Purposely) Unbearable:  Don t think companies haven t studied how far they can take things in providing the minimal level of service,  Mr. Robbins said.  Some organizations have even monetized it by intentionally engineering it so you have to wait an hour at least to speak to someone in support, and while you are on hold, you re hearing messages like,  If you d like premium support, call this number and for a fee, we will get to you immediately.   The most egregious offenders are companies like cable and mobile service providers, which typically have little competition and whose customers are bound by contracts or would be considerably inconvenienced if they canceled their service. Not surprisingly, cable and mobile service providers are consistently ranked by consumers as providing the worst customer support.Of course, companies rated best for tech support often charge more for their products or they may charge a subscription fee for enhanced customer care so the cost of helping you is baked in, as with Apple s customer support service, AppleCare, and theAmazon Prime subscription service.
