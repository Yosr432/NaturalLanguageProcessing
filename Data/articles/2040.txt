This too shall pass: Secret Shuts Down: Anonymous sharing app Secret will shut down soon, according to sources close to the company.

Meerkat, a live-streaming video app that gained great traction early this year, is now grappling with the entrance of Twitter and its Periscope live-video app, for example.
