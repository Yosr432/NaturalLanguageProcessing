Alibaba CEO Urges Workers to Ignore Share Plunge, Keep Focus: Alibaba s chief executive officer exhorted employees Tuesday to ignore plunging stock markets after the e-commerce giant s shares fell below their initial public offering price for the first time. Daniel Zhang, who took the helm of Asia s largest Internet company three months ago, wrote a memo urging his 35,000 workers to brush aside the market turmoil. Alibaba has lost about $128 billion in market value since its November peak amid a slowing Chinese economy.  This is not the first time that the global stock market has plunged,  Zhang wrote in the e-mail.  It is not the last time, either. I hope everyone can shift the focus from the stock market to customers.  Alibaba fell 3.5 percent Monday to close at $65.80 in New York, dropping below its September IPO price of $68 as a global market rout revived investors  concerns about the company s sales growth. The company s shares rose 4.2 percent to $68.57 at Tuesday s close in New York, outlasting a rally in U.S. stocks that evaporated in the final hour of trading.  Let s forget about the stock prices,  Zhang wrote.  We should not be distracted by short-term obstacles, but plan for the future and stick to it.  The Hangzhou-based company s shares peaked at $119.15 in November, with investors eager to reach Alibaba s more than 300 million customers. Their subsequent decline has been fueled by concerns about the decelerating Chinese economy, increased competition from JD.com Inc. and government reports that Alibaba wasn t doing enough to weed out counterfeit goods on its site.
