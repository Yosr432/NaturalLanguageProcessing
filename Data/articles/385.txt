Ford Promises Fleets of Driverless Cars Within Five Years: At a news conference on Tuesday at the company s research center in Palo Alto, Calif., Mark Fields, Ford s chief executive, said the company planned to mass produce driverless cars and have them in commercial operation in a ride-hailing service by 2021.Beyond that, Mr. Fields s announcement was short on specifics. But he said that the vehicles Ford envisioned would be radically different from those that populate American roads now.  That means there s going to be no steering wheel. There s going to be no gas pedal. There s going to be no brake pedal,   he said.  If someone had told you 10 years ago, or even five years ago, that the C.E.O. of a major automaker American car company is going to be announcing the mass production of fully autonomous vehicles, they would have been called crazy or nuts or both.  The company also said on Tuesday that as part of the effort, it planned to expand its Palo Alto center, doubling the number of employees who work there over the next year, from the current 130. Ford also said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. And the automaker announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.
