One of Tech s Best Investors Keeps Passing on Deals Because Valuations Are Too Damn High: Jeremy Levine knows a good deal when he sees one. As a top venture capitalist at Bessemer Venture Partners, he has invested in Pinterest, LinkedIn, Yelp and Shopify well before they reached peak popularity and watched as the last three went public. But over the last 20 months, Levine has led just one new investment, which has yet to be announced. The reason for the pause  Valuations are still just too damn high, he says.  Prices   especially for late stage deals   have been extraordinarily high for a while now and demand flawless execution and a lot of luck,  Levine said in an email following an in-person meeting.  The former is extremely hard to achieve, and the latter is obviously outside anyone s control. Therefore, I believe a lot of the private deals that have [been] getting done recently are providing very poor risk-adjusted-returns for investors.   Perhaps the dramatic cool-off in the public markets over the last week will start to change things in the private markets,  he added.
