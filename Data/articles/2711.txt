The launch of WeChat's free VOIP calling app was marred by problems; Tencent apologized, attributing the crashes to excessive demand: The folks behind China s new WeChat Phonebook were left apologizing on Thursday after its Wednesday launch was marred by severe technical problems. WeChat Phonebook has garnered a lot of interest in China as a way to make your phone smarter and cheaper. The app offers free VOIP calling (as long as you re on wifi) and a variety of convenient services like automatic contact list backup, syncing WeChat avatar images with your contact list, easy group texting, etc. The 1.0 version of the app hit China s Android and iOS app stores yesterday, and while it immediately shot to the top of the charts, it hasn t actually been working for many users. Users have reported being unable to register, log in, recieve confirmation text messages, and make phone calls, among other problems. Since making phone calls is the app s main purpose, that s kind of a big deal. On Thursday, WeChat apologized via the app s official Weibo account for the issues. The cause, it says, is that the app had too many users, leading to service instability.
