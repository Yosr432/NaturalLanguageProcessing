Move Over Mobile Phone: The Next Ad Frontier is the Windshield. The next frontier in digital advertising may be your car s windshield. Automakers, technology companies and glass manufacturers are teaming up to turn the display that graces the front of an iPhone into the windshield of a car -- one that can show ads, directions and vehicle information to the person behind the wheel. The advent of connected cars is creating a new sales battleground, and using a vehicle s windshield may be the next way to pitch more products and services to consumers. McKinsey & Co. estimates that mobile and data-driven services in autos will generate $1.5 trillion by 2030. At least part of that will be spent projecting information to drivers and passengers right before their eyes.  When you think of a person driving and what your needs are when you re on a typical trip, it s food, it s fuel and it s rest stops,  said John Butler, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.  Owning the inside of the car is critical, it s really where the money is made. The real value is locked up in the ad opportunity.  Here s how a smart windshield may work. A driver that s close to running out of gas would see an alert pop up that notes the fuel situation and offers to find a nearby gas station. The car s virtual assistant will offer a choice, again on the windshield, of two options, including directions to a station where the driver is eligible for a free cup of coffee -- an ad placed by the gas company that fits with the driver s buying patterns, also known by his smart car. Panasonic Corp. demonstrated technology at CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week, that lets a driver order and pay for fast food through a heads-up display, before pulling off the freeway to collect it.
