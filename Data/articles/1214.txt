Latest Craze for Chinese Parents: Preschool Coding Classes: Wu Pei began teaching her 6-year-old son to code this year, thinking he d enjoy learning a skill that might boost his future job prospects in an increasingly digitized world. Now, she runs classes in Nanjing, China, and is helping more than 100 parents introduce their children to coding. The 35-year-old former computer programmer with Foxconn Technology Group is tapping growing demand from parents intent on preparing their preschoolers for a world in which Oxford University researchers predict half the jobs in some countries may be eliminated by robots and computers. Similar classes are taking off across China. Reynold Ren has taught about 150 primary school-age children in Beijing to use Scratch, a project developed by the MIT Media Lab and Arduino, which enables users to create interactive objects such as robots. In Hong Kong, about 2,500 students have taken courses that Michelle Sun runs at her First Code Academy.  Teaching the next generation coding is something that should be elevated to a strategical national importance,  said Wang Jiulin, the Xi an-based creator of Kidscode.cn, a website that shares free information and courses.  Even today, the majority of programmers in China can only perform very basic-level tasks and there s huge demand for top notch coders.
