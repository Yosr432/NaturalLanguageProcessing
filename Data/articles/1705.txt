Wal-Mart to Counterattack Amazon s  Prime Day  With Web Sale: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is cutting prices on thousands of products this week in a counterattack to Prime Day, an event Amazon.com Inc. is using to promote its subscription service. Wal-Mart will begin the sale on July 15, the same day as Amazon s much-publicized promotion. During Prime Day, Amazon will offer special discounts to members of its service, which costs $99 a year. As part of the effort, Wal-Mart also is lowering its minimum purchase for free shipping to $35 from $50. The move marks an escalating battle between Wal-Mart s e-commerce site and Amazon, the world s largest online retailer. Wal-Mart also has been developing its own competitor to Prime that will cost $50 a year, half the cost. But it won t have the same speed of delivery as Prime or some of the other perks, such as Amazon s streaming video and music services. Wal-Mart s promotion this week is separate from that push, and the deals are available to all customers. Fernando Madeira, president of Walmart.com, took a dig at Amazon in a blog post on Monday, saying that Wal-Mart s discounts won t just be for people who pay for a membership.
