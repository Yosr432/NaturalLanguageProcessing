Amazon Makes Holiday Shopping Season Tough for Target and Walmart: Neither Target nor Walmart needed a reminder about the distance between their online businesses and Amazon s. Their third-quarter sales numbers provided it anyway. Walmart s online sales grew just 10 percent in the third quarter, slower than the 15 percent industry average, while Target s grew 20 percent, well below the company s stated goal of 30 percent, the companies announced last week. These numbers might not spell all-out trouble if it weren t for Amazon s performance during the same period: The company s electronics and general merchandise business   basically the core of its retail operation   grew 35 percent in North America in the quarter, marking the segment s highest growth rate in several years. The third-quarter headwinds of the traditional retailers coupled with Amazon s momentum makes this e-commerce holiday season an even more critical one for Walmart and Target. It doesn t help that Amazon s huge logistics investments over the last few years mean it can flex its muscles the most during the holiday with its arsenal of express shipping capabilities when customers are often looking for last-minute gifts. If Walmart and Target going to close the gap, now has to be the time. But history isn t on their side.
