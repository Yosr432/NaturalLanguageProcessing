Amazon's North America business up 24% Y/Y, international business continues to drag - down Y/Y Amazon's sales from North America rose 24 percent to $13.4 billion in the quarter ended March 31, the company said. The company said it is continuing to build its Prime delivery business with its one-hour delivery service called Prime Now. It is also investing in original content for its Prime instant video services and devices. The international unit, which accounts for about 35 percent of total sales, remained a drag, with sales for the quarter slipping 1.77 percent to $7.75 billion. Szkutak said Amazon has stepped up its investments, particularly in India, and remains selective in China. "The growth rate in India is very rapid," he said.
