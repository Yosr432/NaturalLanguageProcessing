LinkedIn sues anonymous data scrapers: LinkedIn is trying to lock down its exclusive relationship with its users. The professional networking company filed suit against 100 unnamed individuals last week for using bots to harvest user profiles from its website. The lawsuit is a preliminary step to revealing the identities of the scrapers   LinkedIn intends to ask the court to reveal the true identities behind the scrapers  IP addresses   and a way to maintain its exclusive hold on users  resumes. But LinkedIn s lawsuit also raises questions about how to police bot use. The company, which was recently snapped up by Microsoft for $26.2 billion, has invoked the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in its suit against the unidentified scrapers, claiming that collecting user profiles from the site amounts to hacking. LinkedIn s case accuses the anonymous scrapers of building a massive botnet and circumventing the restrictions LinkedIn uses to prevent profile collection by undesirable third parties. The lawsuit details several of LinkedIn s automated tools that prevent data harvesting. Dubbed FUSE, Quicksand and Sentinel, these tools monitor the web traffic of LinkedIn users and limit how many other profiles a user can view, and how quickly a user can view those profiles. This tracking is intended to prevent scrapers from signing up for fake LinkedIn profiles and then vacuuming up vast amounts of data. The company also uses a tool called Org Block to block IP addresses it suspects of scraping and uses Member and Guest Request Scoring to track page requests. But paradoxically, LinkedIn doesn t want to prohibit scraping altogether. Search engines like Google use bots to index websites and turn up relevant results   and LinkedIn wants to allow this type of scraping to occur.  LinkedIn  whitelists  a number of popular and reputable service providers, search engines, and other platforms so as to permit them to query and index the LinkedIn website, without being subject to all of LinkedIn s security measures,  the company explains in its suit. The scrapers targeted in the lawsuit circumvented LinkedIn s bot-blocking tools by sending their requests through one of these  whitelisted  entities, a third-party cloud service provider.
