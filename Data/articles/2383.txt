Google is making a serious telecom play, and US telcos are nervous: First it conquered search. Then it was online video and advertising. Now Google is turning its attention toward telecom   and it s no experiment. In recent months, Google has said it s bringing ultra-fast Internet to at least 18 cities, including Atlanta and Nashville. It announced pilot tests of a low-cost, modular smartphone. The company s joined an influential lobbying group for upstart telecom firms. And now Google is considering an entry into wireless service, as first reported by The Information, a technology news site founded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Jessica Lessin. All this adds up to what appears to be a serious play in the communications space, with broad implications for what consumers will pay for service, how businesses will compete and even the regulations that affect how Americans experience their technology. Google would reportedly offer wireless service by piggybacking off of Sprint and T-Mobile s networks   essentially paying those companies so that Google can resell their services under its own brand. In addition, it would blend the two networks and allow its customers to hop between them depending on which carrier s signal is strongest. Phones on the Google service would also be able to make calls over WiFi hotspots, meaning that at all times, devices would be hunting for the best of three options. Combine that with its forthcoming smartphone, the Android operating system and the Google-owned apps that ride on top of it all, and you d get a formidable silo of hardware, software and services.
