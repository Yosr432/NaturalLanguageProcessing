Uber China Raises Financing at $7 Billion Valuation: Uber said its China division has raised financing that values that part of the ride-hailing company's operation at $7 billion. Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive officer, discussed the new funds at a press conference in Beijing on Monday. Uber is bumping up against local competitors around the world. Nowhere is the competition more fierce than in China, where Uber faces Didi Kuaidi. The company is backed by Alibaba and Tencent, the country s two most valuable technology companies. Uber and Didi Kuaidi are each spending aggressively to expand, partly by subsidizing the costs of rides. In a letter to investors in 2015, Kalanick committed to spending $1 billion that year in China. It may have surpassed that figure. Didi Kuaidi said on Monday that it completed 1.43 billion trips in 2015. Uber said it increased its share of the private car market in China to 30 percent or 35 percent as of the end of 2015, from 1 percent in January 2015. (The Information reported a similar figure earlier on Monday.) Didi Kuaidi said it holds 87.2 percent of China's private car-hailing market, attributing the figure to a Chinese research firm. A recent round of financing gave Didi Kuaidi a valuation of $16.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said in September. Uber, which owns a controlling stake in Uber China, was last valued at $62.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said in December. Uber China s $7 billion valuation does not include the new cash.
