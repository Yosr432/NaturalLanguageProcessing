Jet, an American marketplace is gaining traction by focusing on the merchant experience rather than the customer experience: The Jet business model is pretty simple.  Jet plans on making their revenue from a $50/yr subscription paid for by members.  Like a warehouse club model (Costco, BJ s, Sams) that will be the primary driver.  Also like a wholesale club model, Jet plans on passing a lot of savings to the member. The merchant model is similar to what you would find at an eBay or Amazon marketplace   you pay a commission for sales based on category.  BUT there are two important differences: A merchant can choose a variable commission based on your own rules (see example below) for shipping, email opt-in, returns and more. Jet takes the commission and instead of pocketing it as profit as other marketplaces do, it returns it to the consumer in the form of Jet savings and behavior based incentives (more on this later).
