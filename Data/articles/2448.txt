Online Storage Company Box Has Strong Debut in First Day of Trading: Although questions had arisen about how Box s initial public offering would fare, public investors gave the company a warm welcome on Friday, its first day of trading. Shares in Box, the online file storage company, opened at $20.20 on Friday morning, 44 percent higher than its I.P.O. price of $14 a share. The stock continued to surge to close the day at $23.23, up nearly 66 percent, giving the company a market value of $2.7 billion. At that level, the start-up has surpassed the $2.4 billion valuation that it fetched in its most recent private financing round last summer. Its strong first-day performance may ease some concerns among investors that highflying Silicon Valley start-ups were looking overvalued. Now that it has gone public, nearly a year after kicking off the process during a period of market upheaval, Box can focus on a more pressing issue: standing out in an industry that has quickly filled with competition, particularly from much bigger rivals like Google and Microsoft.
