Apple sold $6.5 billion in bonds on strong demand..: after boosting the deal by 30 percent, in the iPhone maker s fourth major debt offering in the past two years as it preserves its overseas cash hoard. The company sold the securities in five parts, with the longest portion maturing in 30 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal will be used for stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has issued the equivalent of $39 billion of bonds since April 2013, when it sold $17 billion in what at the time was the biggest corporate-bond offering ever. The Cupertino, California-based company s previous debt deal was a sale of 2.8 billion euros ($3.17 billion) in November that allowed it to fund shareholder rewards without using cash from abroad that would be subject to U.S. repatriation taxes.  The company is building on the momentum of a strong past couple of weeks,  Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which manages $61 billion in assets, said in a telephone interview.  They are being advantageous with the current environment.  The company issued $2 billion of 3.45 percent 30-year notes at a yield of 125 basis points more than similar-dated Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That s more than the relative yield of 100 basis points the company paid on 30-year bonds in the April 2013 offering. The shortest maturity portions included $1.25 billion of 1.55 percent five-year bonds that yielded 42 basis points more than comparable Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Apple s bonds have returned 13.6 percent since the start of last year, outperforming the 10.3 percent gain in debt of similarly rated companies, and more than quadruple the 3.2 percent return on speculative-grade bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes
