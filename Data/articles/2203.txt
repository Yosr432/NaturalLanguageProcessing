Shoppers on Lazada last year spent $350 million as ecommerce booms in Southeast Asia: Rocket Internet s Amazon-esque Lazada saw more than US$350 million in consumer purchases in 2014, group CEO Maximillian Bittner tells Tech in Asia. US$70 million of that spending (termed gross merchandise volume, or GMV) happened in December alone, due to Christmas and special promotions like the 12/12 sales day. The 2014 spending tally represents strong growth for Lazada from US$89 million in 2013. Lazada is this week celebrating its third anniversary. It operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Lazada started out doing only direct sales to consumers from its own warehouses, but that changed in the fall of 2013 as the company launched a marketplace for third-party merchants. Those merchants now take in 70 to 75 percent of the consumer spending on the estore, Bittner reveals. They re a  core driver of growth  on Lazada, he adds. There are now 15,000 merchants using the site as an online storefront.  It s not a target to be a 100 percent marketplace,  Bittner emphasizes.  It depends on the best price for consumers  and other factors such as whether Lazada itself or third-party merchants have better purchasing power. Indonesia is Southeast Asia s largest single market, and Bittner says the archipelago is the top market for Lazada. Indonesia s shoppers made up over 30 percent of Lazada s 2014 spending tally. While Indonesia has an array of homegrown rivals to Lazada   from well-funded Tokopedia to the new Matahari Mall   Bittner says the nation is not necessarily a tougher market than the other Southeast Asian countries.  There s a growing dynamic of excitement  about Indonesia s ecommerce scene right now, adds Bittner. He adds that exclusive online gadget sales for brands like Xiaomi and Motorola have helped Lazada greatly in Indonesia. Xiaomi uses Lazada as its sole sales channel in both Indonesia and the Philippines.
