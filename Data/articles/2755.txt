As Facebook stock has risen, the cost of the Whatsapp acquisition has risen too: from $16B ($4B in cash, $12B in FB stock) originally to $21.8B: For this, Facebook offered $4 billion in cash and $12 billion in stock, with the company s founders eligible for an additional $3 billion in restricted stock. But as Facebook s own stock has continued to rise, so has the value of the deal. The final tally came in at $21.8 billion, as the Deal Professor noted this month. WhatsApp reported a meager $10.2 million in revenue last year, but has 600M users. Mark Zuckerberg spoke about how he wanted to take the mobile messaging app quickly to a billion users from 600 million. ( For us, products really don t get that interesting to turn into businesses until they have about one billion people using them,  he said.)
