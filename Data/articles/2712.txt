Alibaba plans to raise $8 billion in a U.S. bond sale, just two months after its IPO: Asia s largest Internet company is working to issue its first-ever U.S. dollar-denominated notes to refinance its credit facilities, according to a statement today. The bonds have been rated A+, or the fifth highest investment-grade rating, by Standard & Poor s and an equivalent A1 by Moody s Investors Service. The debt issue would be on top of the $25 billion that it collected in a September initial stock offering, which was the biggest share sale on record.

A $4 billion term loan that the company obtained last year pays 2.75 percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from each other, is at about 0.23 percentage point.
