Google Adds a Record $60 Billion to Its Stock in One Day: The search-engine giant added $65 billion to its market capitalization today, more than the size of Hewlett-Packard Co. The surge, following earnings that topped analyst estimates, is the biggest one-day gain in value ever for a U.S. company, according to data compiled by Standard and Poor's Dow Jones Indices. Apple held the previous record, with a $46.4 billion surge in April 2012. Google s rally pushed the Mountain View, California-based company further ahead of Microsoft Corp. in rankings of the world s biggest companies, sending its value to about $468 billion compared with the software giant s $377 billion. The shares are up 26 percent in five days, the biggest one-week advance since it went public in 2004. Thursday s report marked the first time since 2013 that Google has announced quarterly adjusted earnings per share higher than expectations. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who joined the company in May, also signaled plans to bring more restraint to spending at the Internet search giant.
