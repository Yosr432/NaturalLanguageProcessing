Can Apple Do for Wearable Ads What Facebook Did for Mobile  Marketers predict brands will latch onto smartwatches  TapSense this week unveiled what its programmatic ads for the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch will look like, exhibiting a buy-one-get-one-free mock offer from Starbucks. It's at least the second tech company to reveal a programmatic offering for wearables in the last few months, coming on the heels of FitAd's debut with Amtrak. This will be a space to watch in 2015 especially if Apple Watch becomes remotely close to as popular as the iPhone. Wearable device sales are generally expected to achieve significant growth over the next few years, according to researchers. Rest assured, marketers will pay to test return on investment with the emerging formats, and the additional revenue stream could be a boon to CEO Tim Cook's company. "Apple has the opportunity to seize this market of wearable ads, just like Facebook has seized mobile," said Esha Shah, manager of mobile strategy and innovation at Fetch. "Hyper-local ads and coupons could be part of that, as should larger ad opportunities, like voice-based mobile search," he added. Indeed, advertisements on one's wrist seem ripe for direct-response opportunities.
