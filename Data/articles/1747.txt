Twitter Launches "Personas", Aiming To Make It Easier for Advertisers to Target Audience Niches: Twitter wants to make targeting easier for advertisers, so today it unveiled a feature called "personas," which lets brands target groups of consumers based on whether they have college degrees, are parents, make more or less than $100,000 or run small businesses, to name a few. More specifically, marketers can not only target college grads but also pinpoint such alums based on their gender, location and interests. Advertisers could piece together similar targeting parameters on Twitter in the past, but now they can build more precise campaigns with just a mouse click or two. The San Francisco-based tech company is leveraging ongoing partnerships with data companies Acxiom and Datalogix to bring such targeting options to the table. The development is reminiscent of Facebook's people-based marketing product moves of 2014, when it rolled out "Audience Insights" and other similar products. Personas and the campaign insights are now available to advertisers, globally.
