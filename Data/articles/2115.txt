..even as Instagram and Facebook are more entwined than ever, for advertisers, who now have a potentially powerful new marketing strategy using video ads on one to drive sales on the other. Stuart Weitzman, the fashion brand, is one of the first marketers to buy video ads on Instagram, and then send product posts on Facebook to a custom audience of people who viewed the ad. It's an aggressive tactic that incorporates some of the most advanced new ad products from the two social media platforms. Stuart Weitzman also is using cinemagraphs a mix of still imagery and video that Facebook is encouraging marketers to embrace for the creative. "The campaign is about how to find that perfect mix of brand and direct response marketing," said Susan Duffy, CMO of Stuart Weitzman. "One of the exciting things we're doing is using the full marketing funnel." Stuart Weitzman is going after 22- to 40-year-old women, and it's using sequential messaging to influence their buying decisions. One week, the women see the cinemagraphs on Instagram, and the next, they get a product ad on Facebook, thanks to custom targeting tools integrating the two platforms. Facebook has no official stats on how many of its users also are on Instagram, but with more than 1.3 billion people on Facebook and more than 300 million Instagram users, there is plenty of room for overlap.
