Does the LinkedIn sale put Twitter in play  Yes, it does: LinkedIn just gave Twitter investors something they haven t felt in a long time: Hope. News that LinkedIn sold to Microsoft on Monday for more than $26 billion has pushed Twitter stock up more than 8 percent in early-morning trading. The reason  If Microsoft is willing to break the bank for LinkedIn, maybe there s a savior out there for Twitter, too! There have long been talks that a big tech company like Google or Facebook or even Microsoft might swoop in for Twitter. Now that feels almost inevitable, especially given that Twitter s stock is down nearly 60 percent from where it was a year ago when then-CEO Dick Costolo announced he was stepping down. Simply put, that means the LinkedIn acquisition has done more to boost Twitter s value than CEO Jack Dorsey has. Of course, the stock move is typical investor arbitrage, but if Twitter s shares stay up, it's a clear signal investors would rather see it in someone else s hands. Who might save Twitter  It could still be Google, or perhaps a bigger media player like Comcast*. We talk all the time with smart people close to Twitter, and the growing feeling is that Twitter s best option is to finally sell to someone with deep pockets. With LinkedIn now off the market, those deep pockets may come take a closer look.
