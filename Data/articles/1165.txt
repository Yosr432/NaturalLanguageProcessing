Forget China   Google Has to Fight Off Alibaba on Mobile in India: Should Google return some services in mainland China, as many expect it to do soon, it will have to go head to head with China s Internet giants. In the meantime, Google is squaring off against one of them, Alibaba, in India, Google s largest growth market. The Information published a solid look at mobile habits across India, courtesy of data from mobile startup Quettra. Some of the figures aren t surprising. Facebook dominates: Indians love the social site and really love Facebook s WhatsApp   it has 55 million users monthly hours spent, blowing away other messaging apps. Google, though, has a solid lead in utilities and video apps, thanks to YouTube. A potentially troubling sign for the search giant is the race on mobile browsers. The UC browser, which Alibaba acquired last year, is beating Google s Chrome in India, with over five million more monthly hours of use. Alibaba s stripped-down browser takes fourth place. Android dominates India. But Google is still concerned with getting the millions there coming online with smartphones to take their first steps on Google s service, particularly since Facebook is making a similar push. A mobile browser is, for now, one key thing Google has that its U.S. rival does not. But getting mobile users to use services isn t the hard problem in India. It s covering their data costs, which are often prohibitively high. Hence Google s recent push on building lighter, even offline versions of its products. On Monday, Google unveiled an update to the data-saving mode for mobile Chrome that will roll out first in Indonesia and India.
