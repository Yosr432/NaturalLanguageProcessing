As Delivery Costs Rise, Amazon Is Building An App To Let Normal People Deliver Packages For Pay: The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is working on an app internally that would allow the average consumer to make a little cash by picking up Amazon packages at various retail locations and dropping them off at their final destination. WSJ s sources did not have a timeline for the release of this product, internally called  On My Way,  and were unsure whether it would launch at all. Amazon offers its own lockers program, with pick-up stations in various locations (like parking garages) and 7-Eleven stores that are rented out by Amazon. Customers can choose to have their package shipped to one of these lockers for pick-up at their convenience. The WSJ reports that Amazon would likely use a similar logistics structure for the rumored On My Way app, letting users pick up and deliver packages from a convenient location to make some extra money. Besides the standard shipping (or two-day for Prime members), Amazon has fiddled with the idea of letting Uber drivers and yellow cabs deliver products same-day, as well as using bike messengers and third-party delivery services for Prime Now and AmazonFresh, both of which function within hours-long (and not days-long) delivery windows. The company has even talked about launching a fleet of drones to deliver parcels, though that flight faces its own delays.
