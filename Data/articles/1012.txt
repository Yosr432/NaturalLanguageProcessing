Jack Dorsey Juggles Twitter and Square, Both Caught in Downdraft: It is not shaping up as a happy new year for Jack Dorsey and his two companies. Even as the stock market s volatility has dragged down many businesses, Mr. Dorsey and the public tech companies that he runs as chief executive   Twitter, the social network, and Square, the mobile payments company   have been particularly buffeted.Shares of Twitter hit a record low early Wednesday before going on a wild ride and rising 4.1 percent for the day. The gain did little to erase Twitter s negative trajectory, with its shares off 25 percent this year. Square, which went public last November, fell below its initial public offering price of $9 for the first time on Wednesday before recovering. In total, the stock is down 28 percent this year. Square faces its own set of difficulties. Naysayers have long questioned the profit margins on the company s payments processing business. Square takes a small cut of every credit card payment it processes, a cut that is split with banks and other financial intermediaries. The company has expanded into other areas in recent years, such as food delivery and capital extensions to small businesses. Square also is dealing with a relatively small proportion of shares available for trading, since the company sold less than 10 percent of itself in its public offering, in what is known as a  small float  offering. Also, many of Square s executives and major shareholders are still held by the so-called lockup period after the offering, which prohibits them from selling their shares. Companies with relatively few shares outstanding tend to get whipsawed during volatile market periods because it becomes harder to adequately match the small amount of supply for the stock with the demand, or lack thereof.  Those tiny-float I.P.O.s come back to haunt you,  Mr. Wolff of Manhattan Venture Partners said.
