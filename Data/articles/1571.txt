Lenovo quarterly revenue misses expectations, announces 10% cuts: Lenovo missed quarterly revenue expectations on Thursday and said it plans to lay off about 10 percent of its global non-manufacturing workforce, after posting a steep sales decline in its mobile division. The world's No. 1 PC maker said it plans to cut about 3,200 non-manufacturing positions to save $650 million in the second half of 2015 and about $1.35 billion on an annual basis, reflecting intense competition among global smartphone makers. Chief executive Yuanqing Yang said Lenovo would also restructure its lagging smartphone business at a one-time cost of $600 million, and was facing its "toughest market environment in recent years". Lenovo, which last year spent $2.91 billion to buy handset brand Motorola from Google in a bid to solidify its position in smartphones, pointed to "intensifying competition and long product development lifecycles" in the business.
