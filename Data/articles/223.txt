Amazon launches a subscription service for STEM toys: Amazon today unveiled a new subscription program aimed at parents called STEM Club, which delivers educational toys to your home for $19.99 per month. The retailer says it will hand-pick which toys are shipped, and will ensure the items are age-appropriate. And by  STEM,  of course, Amazon means the toys will be focused on the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. The subscription program won t feature just any ol  STEM toys, however, but will rather only include those that have recently launched or those that are exclusive to Amazon.
