Adobe earnings: revenue $1.16 billion, up 9% YoY; shares fall 2%: Photoshop maker Adobe reported that total revenue for quarter ending May 29th rose 8.8 percent to $1.16 billion, in line with analysts' average estimate. Net income rose to $147.5 million from $88 million in the year-ago quarter. The firm recorded better-than-expected profit for the sixth straight quarter, helped by a 12 percent sequential jump in annualized recurring revenue in its digital media segment. However, the company's shares fell about 2 percent in extended trading after it forecast lower-than-expected revenue and profit for the current quarter. Adobe is switching from traditional box licenses to web-based subscriptions for its Creative Cloud software bundle for more predictable recurring revenue. Online subscriptions let customers access the latest software versions for a monthly payment. The company said it expects revenue in its print and publishing business to be relatively flat in the current quarter with the second. Adobe earlier on Tuesday launched Adobe Stock, a collection of 40 million photographs, illustrations and graphics, available in 36 countries and 13 languages.
