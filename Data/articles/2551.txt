Separately, Xiaomi announces the Redmi 2, an improved version of its sub-$150 smartphone: The company s flagship Mi devices may attract all the attention, but the sub-$150 Redmi family is its biggest seller. Back in July of last year, Xiaomi revealed it had sold 18 million Redmi (/Hongmi as it is known in China) phones and 3.56 million Redmi Note phablets. The Redmi alone accounted for one-third of total sales at the time. The Redmi 2 keeps much of the original model s ingredients. It has the same 4.7-inch, 1280 x 720 display, but under the hood there s an upgraded 64-bit Qualcomm 410 quad-core processor. The device sports an 8-megapixel rear camera, improved 2-megapixel front camera, 1GB RAM and 8GB on-device storage. There is now dual 4G SIM support too. The Redmi 2   which runs Xiaomi s own MIUI version of Android   also gives a few more options for color-loving customers.  Lime green  and  powder yellow  are the new additions to the palette. The phone will cost 699 CNY, which is around $112, when it goes on sale on January 9. There s no word on when it will be released outside of China, but you can be sure that the Redmi 2 will make its way to India, Indonesia and Xiaomi s other overseas markets soon.
