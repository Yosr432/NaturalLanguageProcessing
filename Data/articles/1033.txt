You Already Knew Parents Post on Facebook More Than Others. Now Find Out How Much:  Its an old joke that moms and dads love to post photos of their kids on Facebook. But thanks to the social network's research with Ipsos Media they surveyed 8,000 people in eight countries and Facebook's internal data analysis, we now know just how true that idea is. Some of the more interesting findings came from its U.S.-based study. For instance, new American moms post 2.5 times more status updates, 3.5 times more photos and 4.2 times more videos than nonparents, per Facebook's internal stats. And hey, the updates work: New parents' posts (those from moms or dads) about their babies get 37 percent more interactions from family members and 47 percent more interactions from friends than their general posts. And more than most people, new moms and dads worldwide seem to be uploading posts from their smartphones. The global end of the research which included 1,000 people from the U.S., U.K., Canada, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Germany and Australia, respectively found that new parents use Facebook mobile 1.3 times more often than nonparents, Facebook found.
