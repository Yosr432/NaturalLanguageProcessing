Facebook Blocks Ad Blockers, but It Strives to Make Ads More Relevant: Digital ads pop up online so frequently and ubiquitously that many people are using software to block them. But if you try to stop ads from showing up onFacebook s desktop website, you will now be out of luck: The social network has found a way to block the ad blockers. On Tuesday, Facebook flipped a switch on its desktop website that essentially renders all ad blockers   the programs that prevent websites from displaying ads on the page when a user visits the site   useless. The change allows the Silicon Valley company to serve ads on its desktop site even to people who have ad-blocking software installed and running.Facebook s move is set to add to a furious debate about the ethics of ad blocking. On one hand, many digital ads are a nuisance   they slow loading times of web pages and detract from the online experience. Yet the ads also serve as the business foundation for many digital publishers to provide content to readers. Ad blockers have become a threat to publishers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which are facing declining advertising revenue. About 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software on their desktop computers, according to estimates from PageFair, an anti-ad-blocking start-up. An additional 420 million use ad blockers on their smartphones, the company said. Several digital publishers, including Wired, Forbes and The Times, have begun experimenting with anti-ad-blocking techniques, including asking visitors who use ad blockers to  whitelist  their sites so that ads may still appear.
