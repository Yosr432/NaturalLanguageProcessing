Housing crisis puts SoftBank in a spot amidst its headline grabbing announcements: The fall of Housing.com from one of the hottest tech startups in India to a big public relations disaster has been quick, thanks to its just ousted CEO Rahul Yadav. And this has put the largest owner of Housing Japanese internet giant SoftBank, one of the biggest internet investors from Asia with $70B in revenue in a delicate spot. Only six months ago it wrote a $90 million cheque for this college startup in exchange of a 32.5 per cent stake, but it appears SoftBank is already exploring a sale. Sources familiar with developments at the online real estate company said Quikr-Housing.com deal, as reported by VCCircle, is in works but it may not be easy to fructify due to several reasons including a mismatch in valuation expectations. SoftBank, Housing s biggest stakeholder, is said to be seeking a price of $350 million which none of its rivals would want to cough up considering the startup s main asset is its product and technology and not so much the business (revenues). As an immediate sale may prove to be daunting, sources say SoftBank s current priority would be to stabilise the affairs at the startup while also increase the monetisation efforts rather than stepping up the sell-off initiatives.  They wanted to make a big bang entry into India with a $1 billion investment, make a splash, and get a meeting with (Prime Minister) Modi..,  said a venture capital investor who manages a diverse portfolio, indicating the Japanese giant might have made a mistake in a hurry to invest.
