India Poised to Reject Apple s Demand for Manufacturing Sops: India is not in favor of offering Apple Inc. concessions to start manufacturing iPhones in the country, a government official told reporters on Tuesday. The government is also unlikely to ease norms governing local sourcing for the manufacturer of iPads and iPhones as such a step can t be granted to just one company, according to the New Delhi-based official, who didn t want to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media.
