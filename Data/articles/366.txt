Tesla s new 100 kWH battery makes it the third-fastest accelerating car ever: Tesla s Model S and Model X vehicles just got faster. On a call with journalists today, Elon Musk unveiled a larger battery pack   100 kWH   that enables the Model S to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds in what the company calls  ludicrous  mode. That makes the Model S the third-fastest production car ever made, after the Ferrari LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder, but it s the quickest pure electric vehicle that has the capacity to seat up to five adults and two children, according to the company. In an industry first, the battery also enables the car to drive an estimated 315 miles on a single charge. This is the first electric vehicle to go above a range of 300 miles, according to Tesla. The Model S P100D will start at $135,000   compared to a $125,000 MSRP for the Model S P90D equipped with ludicrous mode   and the Model X P100D will start at $135,500. The Model X P90D started at $115,500.
