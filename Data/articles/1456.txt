Alibaba s $141 Billion Slide Boosts Tencent to Biggest in Asia: Alibaba surrendered the title of Asia s largest Internet company to Tencent Holdings Ltd., capping a 10-month slide for the e-commerce giant that wiped $140.7 billion from its market value. The shares of Alibaba fell 4.7 percent to $60.91 at the close in New York on Tuesday, making the online marketplace worth $153 billion. That s below Tencent s value for the first time since billionaire Jack Ma oversaw Alibaba s record-breaking initial public offering in September 2014. Alibaba s reliance on consumer spending in China, where it gets 83 percent of its revenue, leaves it vulnerable to the domestic slowdown. Tencent is adding pressure by buying Hollywood content for its video platform, investing in cloud computing and on-demand mobile services, while forging an e-commerce alliance with JD.com. China may have lent its shares a hand. Last month, the government cut rates for the fifth time since November and resumed intervening in equities, seeking to arrest a stock market rout that wiped out trillions of dollars in value. That s helped prop up stocks in neighboring Hong Kong. Tencent posted record quarterly profit in August. By comparison, Alibaba trailed analysts  revenue forecasts in two of the past four quarters, and its sales grew at the slowest pace in at least three years. Tencent is capitalizing on the more than 1 billion users of WeChat and QQ. Billionaire Chairman Ma Huateng is finding new ways to make money through advertising, payment services and health care through the apps. Tencent earns more than half its revenue from games, and in April invested $126 million in San Francisco-based Glu Mobile Inc. to add a portfolio of action and role-playing games for smartphones.
