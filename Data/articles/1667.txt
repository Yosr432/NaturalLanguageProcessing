More on the launch of Jet - Jet is here. Let the price wars begin.: After months of testing and tweaking, the e-commerce start-up Jet.com opened its digital storefront on Tuesday, marking the official kickoff of the company's ambitious effort to battle Amazon and Wal-Mart for budget-conscious customers. Jet is taking a new approach to pricing. Its algorithm doesn't simply look at the price of each individual item in your online shopping cart. It looks at all the items you want to buy, as well as your Zip code, to determine which retailer or warehouse can ship that unique combination of items to you the cheapest. Shoppers can only buy things on Jet if they've signed up for a $49-per-year membership. Ad Week reports that in this online store, viewing ads could lead to discounts as Jet.com is lowering bills wherever it can. It's a risky business model. Lore has to get Jet.com to $20 billion in revenue by 2020 to make the site profitable. That kind of revenue means it would have to become one of the most successful e-commerce players in the world. The only money Jet.com would make comes from the $50 membership fee users pay to access the savings, which average about 15 percent on everything from detergent to sofas. The site offers deeper discounts depending on variables such as whether a customer pays with a credit or debit card, whether the order can be filled with an efficient shipping route, and whether the consumer waves the right to return items. All these little options help whittle down the price of a basket of goods.
