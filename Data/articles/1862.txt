Tinder Goes Through A Small Round Of Layoffs; spring-cleaning, not restructuring, company says. Tinder   one of the most popular dating apps currently available across the globe   laid off around 10 percent of its staff last week. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company laid off six members of the 60-65 member team, including three marketing employees and three engineers. TechCrunch was told this wasn t part of a re-structuring, or even a result of leadership changes with new CEO Chris Payne and VP of Engineering Hugh Williams, but rather a spring-cleaning of sorts. Tinder has gone through much larger transitions before, including a lawsuit waged by former VP of Marketing Whitney Wolfe, the resignation of CMO Justin Mateen, and the transition of Sean Rad from CEO to President. Since then, Chris Payne has joined the team as CEO and Hugh Williams has taken over the engineering squad. The first year of monetization can be tricky for any social startup, and with the complexities of Tinder Plus   ads, premium features, oddball pricing, etc.   it would make sense to double-check that the team is as lean as possible.
