US Startup Funding Deals Fall to Lowest Level in Four Years - Different Story in India and China: Venture capitalists made fewer bets in the U.S. last quarter, while putting a larger proportion of their money into the most mature private companies, according to research firm PitchBook Data. The findings show that venture investors are trying to play it safe by backing proven businesses, making it more difficult for newer startups to find capital. Last quarter had the fewest number of venture deals in four years. Funding rounds dropped 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, when startup funding began to slow. Investments totaled $17.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016, about flat with the prior period. More than half of that went to late-stage companies. Private investors are expressing skepticism as startup valuations have skyrocketed. Mutual fund companies have written down the value of their stakes in numerous technology companies since last year. Startups are staying private longer, leaving fewer options for shareholders to cash out. No tech company went public last quarter, and many of those that did in 2015 have gotten off to a rocky start. In other countries, there's plenty of money to go around. Venture capital investments in China and India surged in the first quarter, jumping about 50 percent.
