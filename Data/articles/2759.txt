Twitter earnings (Q3 rev: $361M, 114% Y/Y, net loss $175M) beat estimates, but the stock was still down 10% on engagement worries and lack of product innovation: Twitter is doing a great job monetizing (especially on mobile:85% of revenue from mobile), but engagement is stagnating: not enough new users (monthly active users rose only 23% to 284 million in the quarter) and decreasing engagement per user (timeline views per user slid 7% globally to 636).  The lack of growth there comes from Twitter s relative lack of innovation,  said Nate Elliott, an analyst at Forrester who studies social media.  The experience on Twitter today is the same experience people have always had on Twitter.
