Paytm s big day: IRCTC adds Paytm wallet as a payment option: Government-owned railway ticketing platform IRCTC, which is the one of the most used internet commerce site in the country clocking on an average over half a million tickets a day, has added Paytm s wallet as an online payment option. IRCTC, the primary seller of railway tickets online (others OTAs act as secondary link) in the country, has been offering various online payments options besides the conventional credit/debit cards and net banking. It allows payments through cash cards, its own co-branded pre-paid Rupay card with Union Bank and with Paytm wallet it adds another payment option. Last we checked the Paytm payment option was integrated on IRCTC s web portal but was not yet available on its mobile app on Android. The development means a big move for Paytm as it is already available as an alternate payment option in several key internet ventures such as the country s top online food ordering venture Foodpanda, cab hailing app Uber (in India), eBay and Jabong. Although IRCTC has come a long way in terms of streamlining online payment process on its site, given the huge load on its servers it is not uncommon to see payment failures in a multi-authentication process which comes with a credit and debit cards. Paytm wallet would look to capitalise in partly solving this pain point for users and hopes to also expand its reach in tier-II and tier-III markets, where trains are a primary mode of long distance travel and IRCTC by default is the booking platform.
