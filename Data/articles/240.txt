SpaceX nailed its first launch since last year s big explosion: Early Saturday morning Jan. 14, SpaceX successfully launched ten communication satellites made by Iridium   one of its largest satellite customers   into low earth orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The mission, part of a larger effort to replace at least 70 of Iridium s satellites by 2018, was a much-needed positive start to what should be a busy year for SpaceX. SpaceX has a lot to accomplish in 2017, but it s crucial to remember that all of this is in service of the company s ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. That s why each commercial launch is critical for the company Elon Musk founded 15 years ago. Not only is it proving that the technology works, but each contract is helping Musk fund his ambitious and expensive mission to colonize Mars. Saturday s unblemished execution   from launch, to completing the mission of deploying the satellites, to landing back on its drone ship   is a good sign for the company, particularly after one of its $60 million rockets exploded with a $200 million satellite on it last August.
