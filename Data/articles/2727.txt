Vee, an Indian mobile dating app gets $1M pre-series A funding, even as Momo, a similar Chinese app files for $300M US IPO: Founded in April this year, Vee received $1 million in its pre-Series A. Vee is a dating app that connects people who are single with others having the same tastes. It essentially helps users find out companions around their area and get into mutual relationships. The company claims that Vee can predict one s approximate location, and based on the algorithms that work on the backend, it recommends people they may like around their area. For instance, when you see a profile on the app, you can like him/her anonymously. The other person will not get to know about it until he/she likes you back. The app connects you with people only when both the users have liked each other. As soon as you are connected, you can start chatting with them using the app. The interesting thing is that women users can choose to make the chats disappear in 30 seconds (so that they don t have to worry about leaving a trail), and you can connect with multiple persons at a time. A free app, Vee is currently available on Android as well as iOS platforms. With the app, the company is targeting the youth population within the age group of 18-28.  We have seen more than 50,000 downloads across iOS and Android already. Over 23,000 pairs have been created and around 4.4 million messages exchanged on the platform so far,  explained Gupta. The firm is also looking to monetise the app in the near future by introducing a paid subscription model, wherein it will make a customised match to its premium subscribers and will organise meeting events for them.
