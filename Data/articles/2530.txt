Facebook acquires a video startup that enhances low-bandwidth video-viewing and reduces buffering of videos without degradation in quality: Facebook has a acquired QuickFire Networks, a TC Disrupt 2014 Battlefield contestant that built a custom hardware and software platform for reducing video file sizes and upload times. The Wall Street Journal got the news earlier today, with confirmation later arriving on QuickFire s site. QuickFire s tech speeds up encoding videos with different profiles for frame rate, resolution, color and audio settings for different platforms. QuickFire s solution relied on custom motherboards built to accommodate 11 high-end Intel Core i7 processors. Custom software let these processors work in unison, and a layer on top of that let the startup massively scale up by distributing work among multiple motherboards. For users, the end result of Facebook integrating QuickFire s tech would be reduced buffering of videos without degradation in quality.
