Amazon has installed 15,000 robots in 10 of its 50 US warehouses. (article here, video here):  The robots are made by Kiva, acquired by Amazon in 2012 for 775M. Each robot weighs 320 lbs, and can carry 750 lbs. The robots are guided by stickers on the warehouse floors. This is fast and space-efficient: unloading a trailer now takes 30 minutes, instead of hours. Each warehouse can now hold up to 50% more inventory because racks can be placed closer together. The robots typically run for 2 hours before needing a recharge (which they do on their own). The robots can thus work 24x7 and fulfil an order every 20seconds. In some cases, the robots have allowed Amazon to get packages out the door in as little as 13 minutes from the pick stations, compared to about an hour and a half on average in older centers. The move comes at a cost. Amazon estimated in June 2013 that it would spend about $46 million to install Kiva robots at its warehouse in Ruskin, Florida, including $26.1 million for the equipment, according to company filings to local government.
