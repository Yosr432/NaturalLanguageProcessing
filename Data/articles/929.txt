Cybersecurity concerns - Why US Naval Academy students are learning to sail by the stars for the first time in a decade: batteries run out, systems get hacked, and even advanced technology can be balky. In a pinch   or in a war   sailors need something to fall back on. And stars and sextants have been working pretty well for hundreds of years. So the Naval Academy started teaching its sailors how to navigate ships by looking to the heavens again this academic year. The training was dropped altogether in 2006.  I thought that we had computers and all that for navigation,  Hogan, 20, a Charleston, S.C., native said this week during a class on the subject. But amid concerns about cyberattacks and new weapons that can shut off the electricity of a ship or a plane, the Naval Academy made celestial navigation a requirement for third-year students.  Redundancy is the best policy,  said Lt. Alex Reardon, who taught three sections of the class. Especially because, when it comes to a Navy ship on the open seas,  we re typically alone in what we do.  That could be a major problem in the event of a cyberattack, said Salvatore Mercogliano, an assistant professor focused on naval history at Campbell University and a former merchant mariner. During World War II, the U.S. began using land-based radio beacons known as the LORAN system to help guide ships. And the space race helped further celestial navigation s decline: The Navy sponsored the development of the first operational satellite navigation system, dubbed TRANSIT, which went into active service in 1964   providing navigation assistance for naval submarines and surface vessels. But TRANSIT was retired in the mid- 90s after the Air Force completed the modern GPS system, which uses dozens of satellites circling the globe.
