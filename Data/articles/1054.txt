Samsung's Earnings Miss Underlines Sputtering Global Demand: Samsung Electronics s profit miss is the latest sign the global smartphone market is running out of steam, spelling trouble for the suppliers of displays, semiconductors and other components that go into mobile devices. The world s largest maker of displays and memory chips, which sells to Apple and many other brands, posted fourth-quarter profit that fell short of analysts  estimates as sales remained sluggish over the holiday season. Demand is waning for smartphones as markets mature and China s economy slows, pressuring profit margins at Samsung. Concerns that the smartphone market is fizzling out has spurred analysts to trim estimated demand, which in turn has hammered device vendors as well as suppliers of components and contract assemblers. Apple, which garners most of the industry s profits, ended Thursday below $100 for the first time in over a year after investment brokerages from UBS  to Morgan Stanley lowered forecasts on iPhone shipments. Samsung phone shipments are headed for their second straight annual decline in the wake of tougher competition from Apple in the high-end segment to China s Xiaomi  and Huawei. for budget consumers. Yet even Xiaomi, which rose from obscurity to become the country s biggest phone brand, may have missed its 80-million unit sales target in 2015, people with knowledge of its production plans have said.
