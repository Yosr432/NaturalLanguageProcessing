Uber's Rival Lyft Plans to Raise Up to $1 Billion in New Funds: Ride-hailing company Lyft plans to raise as much as $1 billion in new funds, according to a Delaware state filing, in a round of financing analysts said could sharply boost the valuation of Uber s largest U.S. rival. Lyft didn t indicate in the Friday evening filing how much had been raised, who was investing in the round or list a valuation. Sven Weber, a financial filings expert, pegged the pre-money valuation at about $4.5 billion while Justin Byers at VC Experts estimates it closer to $3.9 billion. Lyft was valued at $2.5 billion when it announced a previous funding round in March. The latest fundraising round contained some downside protection for new investors, including the provision of extra shares should Lyft go public at a lower valuation. Lyft is competing aggressively with Uber, which recently filed to raise $2.1 billion at a $62.5 billion valuation. The discrepancies in the valuations reflect Uber s pole position in the U.S. and its global ambitions. On Dec. 3, Lyft said it was teaming up with Uber s biggest rivals in Asia, including China s Didi Kuaidi, Singapore s GrabTaxi, India s Ola, to form a global alliance that will make their apps cross-compatible for travelers. Lyft lost $127 million in the first half of 2015 on $46.7 million in revenue, according to fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg. It said last month it has gained market share in key markets such as San Francisco, and has a gross revenue  run rate  of $1 billion.
