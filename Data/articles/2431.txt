Facebook video is on fire: Facebook Now Has Over 3B Video Views Per Day: If it s starting to feel like every visit you make to Facebook these days is full of videos, you are not alone. Facebook today reported in a strong set of Q4 earnings that there are 3 billion videos viewed on its site each day. With the company also reporting daily active users of 890 million, this works out to more than 3 videos per day. Facebook more specifically later noted that over 50% of people in the US who come to Facebook daily watch at least one video per day. It doesn t break out how many of those are auto-played but did noted that over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out in the call that while usage of Facebook has shifted over the last ten years, from primarily text through to  primarily photos with some text and video,  he may be understating things a bit. As a point of comparison, he noted that there are 2 billion photos each day shared across Facebook sites   or, put another way, 1 billion less photos than videos posted to Facebook daily. And as a sign of just how much Facebook is pushing video growth, it was only in June 2014 that the company passed 1 billion video views per day. Facebook said that in the last year, the number of video posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Facebook reported $3.6 billion in advertising sales on overall revenues of $3.85 billion but did not break out how much of that came from video advertising versus other formats.
