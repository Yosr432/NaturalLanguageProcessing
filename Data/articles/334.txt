AngelList Braces for Rainy Days as Startup Seed Funding Falls: AngelList is preparing for winter. The company, which runs an online portal connecting entrepreneurs with private investors, is assembling a  rainy day  fund and exploring new businesses as the market for investing in young startups slows. Naval Ravikant, the chief executive officer and co-founder of the San Francisco startup, said he s looking outside Silicon Valley to keep the money flowing in a downturn. He aims to secure commitments from sovereign-wealth funds, endowments and other investors around the world to invest $1 billion through AngelList in the coming years. Last year, China s CSC Venture Capital, the U.S. arm of private-equity firm China Science & Merchants Investment Management Group, committed $400 million, he said.  If there s a cash crunch and valuations come down drastically, then that s when you want to be investing,  said Ravikant, a prolific seed investor who made early bets on Uber Technologies Inc. and Twitter Inc.  That s what raising this institutional money is about. It s our rainy day money.   The rapid rise of AngelList coincided with a startup boom. The website has facilitated seed investments by mainly wealthy Americans in more than 1,000 startups, as well as funding for some later-stage companies, including Cruise Automation and Dollar Shave Club, which were each acquired this year. AngelList typically takes a 5 percent cut of the profit from each investment made through its platform, which it collects once a startup gets bought or goes public. It also plays the role of investor through a $20 million fund, which it recently exhausted, and a newer $35 million fund.
