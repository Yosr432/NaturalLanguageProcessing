Tech Titans Come Together To Develop Common Container Standard: Docker, CoreOS, Google, Microsoft and Amazon are now working on a new standard for software containers with the help of the Linux Foundation. Docker may have become synonymous with containers, but it s not the only container format around and not everybody agrees that it should become the standard format. Docker and CoreOS had looked like they were on a collision course, and having even more container formats wasn t likely going to help the overall ecosystem. Now, however, the two companies are going to work together with other stakeholders on the Open Container Project (OCP), which will be housed under the Linux Foundation. The OCP is a nonprofit organization that is  chartered to establish common standards for software containers.  The Docker container format and runtime will form the basis of the new standard, and Docker is donating both the draft specifications and the code around its image format and runtime engine to get the project started. The main idea here is that developers should be able to package their applications in a container and be confident that it will run in any runtime, whether that s Docker, CoreOS s rkt, or projects like Kurma or Jetpack. That standard should be vendor neutral and development should happen out in the open. Containers are isolated user instances that allow applications to be deployed easily; Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.
