Payments at a Tipping Point: Password-less authentication will drive more mobile transactions in 2015: "Today, 85 percent of transactions are still done via cash, but 2014 started changing the game for payments, and I believe we re at an inflection point to push more payments than ever into the digital realm for 2015 thanks to innovations in authentication, shopping on social networks, and near field communication-based payment technology.  The truth is only about 1 percent of commerce happens on mobile today, which is hard to believe considering there are now more mobile devices than people in the world. But I think that s all about to change, and authentication is going to be an even bigger driver in mobile shopping and conversion in 2015."
