Tesla Falls on Sales Target Cut to as Few as 50,000 Vehicles: Tesla Motors fell in extended trading after the electric-car maker backed off its full-year vehicle sales forecast. Tesla said it now aims to deliver 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles this year, compared with a previous target of 55,000. The company sees third-quarter production and deliveries of just more than 12,000 vehicles including just a few Model X sport utility vehicles. Reaching the initial target may be a stretch because some interior suppliers might not be able to increase the flow of high-quality parts fast enough to meet the Model X production plan, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on a conference call with analysts. Because the SUV and the existing Model S share the same assembly line, a shortfall by one Model X supplier could slow output of both vehicles. Tesla stock fell 5.8 percent after tumbling as much as 9.3 percent following regular trading. Tesla had gained 21 percent this year through Wednesday s close, outpacing the 2.4 percent increase by the Russell 1000 Index. Some analysts had been skeptical about Tesla s plans to increase deliveries by 74 percent this year, especially with so much of the increase coming late in the year.
