Google Unveils Buy Button on Ads in Mobile-Commerce Push, Ties Up With Flipkart, Ebay on Deep Links: Google Inc. is testing a feature to let consumers purchase products by clicking through advertisements, seeking to expand options for mobile retail sales. The Internet-search company s service, Purchases on Google, will let people using smartphones click on select search ads that take the users directly to a retailer-branded product page hosted by Google, according to an e-mail. The tools will work with a  limited number of retailers  for now, the company said. The company also announced an effort to alert smartphone users to information such as sales and loyalty programs at nearby stores, through its Google Now program. Google is expanding information on product ratings in ads and giving users more data on local inventory, as well. The Mountain View, California-based company will make it simpler for ads to drive consumers to shopping apps, rather than to retailer s websites. EBay and Flipkart, an e-commerce site based in India, are among the early partners in the initiative, which uses a technology called deep links.
