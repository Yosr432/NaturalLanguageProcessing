Amazon is going into the film production business: After winning acclaim for one of its original television productions, Amazon announced on Monday that it would produce and acquire films for theatrical release and early distribution on its Prime Instant Video service. Amazon original movies will be available for streaming in the United States four to eight weeks after they make their debut in theaters, a significant reduction of the window of 39 to 52 weeks that films normally play in theaters before becoming available for streaming. The development is another step in Amazon s ambitious plan to increase its entertainment offering to consumers, and an escalation in Amazon s rivalry with Netflix. It also signals both companies  broader ambitions to revolutionize the so-called windowing system for television and movies in the traditional entertainment industry. Amazon said it was seeking to create 12 movies a year that  focus on unique stories, voices and characters from top and up-and-coming creators.  Production will start this year. In an email, Roy Price, vice president of Amazon Studios, described the projects as  indie  movies, with budgets between $5 million and $25 million. Analysts cautioned that if the films were low-budget and of low quality, it would be difficult for them to profoundly alter the conventional system for theatrical releases.
