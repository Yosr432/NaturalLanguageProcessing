BlackBerry's Bet on Software Over Handsets Begins to Pay Off: BlackBerry Ltd. boosted its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook and posted a profit in the third quarter, showing the company s bet on moving more into software and completely away from handsets is paying off. Fiscal third-quarter earnings per share, excluding some items, were 2 cents, compared with analysts  average estimate of a loss of 1 cent. BlackBerry said it now expects to post a profit for the full year, up from a prior range of break even to a five-cent loss, according to a statement Tuesday. Shares rose as much as 4.4 percent, the biggest intraday gain in two months. They were up 1.2 percent to $7.80 at 1:26 p.m. in New York. Total revenue declined and missed estimates, but the profit numbers and forecast show BlackBerry s transition to a higher-margin software company from ailing smartphone maker is hitting Chief Executive Officer John Chen s targets. The adjusted profit margin was almost 70 percent of revenue, its highest ever.  I don t consider ourselves in a turnaround anymore,   Chen told reporters at the company s headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario.  We ll make money this year. Nobody believed us in the beginning.
