Offline Viewing of Video From Amazon Prime Streaming: Amazon said it would allow members of its $99 annual Prime loyalty program free downloads of some shows and movies from its streaming video service to watch offline, or when no Internet connection is available. The programs will be available via the Amazon Video app for iOS or Android. Shows will be downloadable to Apple and Android phones and tablets, including Amazon s Fire devices   but not to desktops or laptops. Available programs include  Downton Abbey  and  The Good Wife,  HBO shows including  Girls  and  Veep  and movies including  The Hunger Games: Catching Fire  and  The Wolf of Wall Street.
