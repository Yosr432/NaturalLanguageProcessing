Xiaomi forecasts $16B in revenue, >50% growth this year: Xiaomi Corp. expects revenue this year to rise more than 50 percent as China s biggest smartphone vendor diversifies its product lineup and expands to more overseas markets. The projection for more than 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) in sales compares with last year s total of 74.3 billion yuan, founder and Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun told reporters at the National People s Congress in Beijing Thursday. The company s revenue more than doubled last year. Xiaomi s valuation has surged to $45 billion just four years after releasing its first smartphone, with the company tapping the surging domestic demand for inexpensive devices packed with high-end features. The closely held company has taken stakes in more than 20 startups in the past two years, adding products including air purifiers and light bulbs that can be controlled by smartphones.  There s no doubt sales will surpass 100 billion yuan this year, and growth will be more than 50 percent,  Lei said. Mobile Internet and other Internet businesses  maintain strong growth  amid weakening conditions in the Chinese economy.
