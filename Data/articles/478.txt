Google just scored a bunch of new property to make its crazy dream campus come true: Google couldn t score LinkedIn s business. But it s getting LinkedIn s real estate. On Tuesday, the two companies announced a large, surprising property swap encompassing over three million square feet of existing and future real estate, including LinkedIn s corporate headquarters. The companies wouldn t share financial terms, but they said neither side paid a premium for the properties. From Google, LinkedIn is picking up seven buildings, a plan it said will consolidate its staff around its Sunnyvale and Mountain View Calif., offices. The company said the deal is unrelated to its recent Microsoft acquisition. In return, Google is getting LinkedIn s Mountain View headquarters office and   far more critical for the internet giant   four different surrounding properties that enable Google to follow through on its ambitious plan for a new, green, crazy-futurist campus. But here s the kernel: Google proposed the aforementioned crazy-futurist campus in early 2015. It was a big deal; the  genius  architect behind it got a magazine cover. Then LinkedIn spoiled the fun: Mountain View s city council voted last May to cede the property to LinkedIn, blocking Google s grand vision. But now the runway for Google is clear.
