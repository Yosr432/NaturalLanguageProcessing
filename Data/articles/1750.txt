Venture Investment In Healthcare Declines Through Q2 After Record 2014: After a record-breaking year of growth in 2014, venture capital investors in healthcare seem to have settled into a groove. They invested roughly $2.8 billion in healthcare technologies through the second quarter of 2015, down from $3.3 billion over the same period last year, according to a study from Startup Health. Nearly $6.8 billion went into healthcare technologies that year, up from $3 billion the year before. Driven by twin engines of government legislation and technology innovation around wearable devices and data, venture capital investments in healthcare went up like a rocket in 2014. Now, the industry seems to be catching its breath a bit. Investments in healthcare technology actually held steady in the second quarter at $1.8 billion after a $500 million decline year-on-year in the first quarter. An examination of some of the companies that have raised the most money and successfully exited: Zenefits and Oscar Health , which are tackling the regulatory changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act, raised more than respectable $500 million and $145 million rounds, respectively. While Nant Health, a company using big data analytics for genomic sequencing, and HealthCatalyst, which uses data to track health across populations, both scored big with their own big rounds of $200 million and $70 million. On the wearables side, the FitBit public offering proved that even public markets were interested in the wearable health opportunity.
