Meerkat Makes Friends With Facebook s API, moves on from Twitter: Live streaming app Meerkat rolled out several major updates this morning, including the ability to sign up on the platform through Facebook instead of Twitter, a feature that lets you invite those watching your stream to take over that stream, and it now facilitates saving streams in something called the Meerkat Library instead of on your phone. Meerkat was on a roll shortly after launching earlier this year, thanks largely due to Twitter s social graph. Meerkat would tweet out that users were live on the platform every time they started a stream. More people started streaming, more tweets went out. But then came Periscope, Twitter s rival platform. Twitter then blocked Meerkat from its social graph and that was the end of that romance. It looks like Meerkat has moved on from its breakup and is now in the friendly arms of Facebook. Even with the bad blood betwixt them, folks still had to have a Twitter account to sign up on the app. Now they just need Facebook.
