After Disney and Activision, now Nintendo launches physical toys that can interact with digital games via NFC: Toy companies had been trying for years to bridge the gap between physical and digital toys, applying different strategies but finding limited success. Like recent physical-virtual crossover hits from Disney and Activision, Nintendo figurines use the technology known as near-field communication to send signals to a device connected to the game console. For Disney and Activision, the toys are required to play the related games. Starter kits are about $75, and figures start at about $13. The Nintendo toys are not required to play the related games, but instead offer bonus features. Each character is $13. Activision s approach has been to add new features and types of toys to each installment. This fall, the company released Skylanders Trap Team, in which players can insert a physical crystal-shaped item in a base to trap virtual villains.
