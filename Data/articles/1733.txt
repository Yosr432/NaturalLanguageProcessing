Samsung Profit Misses Estimates on Galaxy S6 Phone Struggles: Samsung Electronics posted second-quarter profit that missed analysts  estimates as shortages of new smartphones made it harder to lure customers from Apple s iPhone and cheaper devices made in China. Operating income fell 4 percent to 6.9 trillion won ($6.1 billion) in the three months ended June, the company said in a filing Tuesday. That compares with the 7.2 trillion won average of 33 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung s seventh straight profit drop comes as Galaxy S6 phone sales have fallen short after winning early praise as a device that could attract users that had shifted to Apple s iPhone 6. Production constraints for the model with a curved display have led to shortages, trimming sales of the device and forcing the company to rely more on its chip unit for earnings. The company's shares were little changed in trading in Seoul.
