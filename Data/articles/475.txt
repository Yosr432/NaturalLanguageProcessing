Zendesk s  Automatic Answers  taps machine learning, AI to generate bot-style email responses: Chat bots have ballooned in popularity in recent months, and now we re seeing some interesting examples of how that technology, where computers interact and respond to human requests, is being used to solve other problems. Today,Zendesk is taking the wraps off  Automatic Answers , a service for businesses to reply to emails from customers without ever having a human employee get involved. Automatic Answers is not your average, run-of-the mill email autoresponder. The service was built using a machine learning platform that Zendesk s in-house teams of data scientists and engineers, which are based out of Melbourne, Australia, have been developing on for a while now. That machine learning platform was first announced last year and it also powers a service Zendesk announced last October, Satisfaction Prediction, which is able to monitor customer-company interactions to   as its name implies   determine whether the customer is getting what she or he needs. The machine learning/AI element means that the responses in Automatic Answers are not only reading and responding specifically to what you the customer is asking, but it is technically getting smarter with each response (and presumably using a bit of Satisfaction Prediction to figure out if it s getting it right). Automatic Answers will work first in email because, as Zendesk s VP of product Sam Boonin tells me,  Even in a world of customer services embedded in every communication channel from social to web to phone, email still represents the majority of interactions that are coming in.
