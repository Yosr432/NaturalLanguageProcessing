LinkedIn to Buy Lynda.com, an Online Learning Company: LinkedIn, the professional networking site, is branching out yet again. The site said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Lynda.com, an online learning company that teaches career skills, for about $1.5 billion in cash and stock. It is the biggest acquisition by LinkedIn in its 12-year history as it continues to expand beyond its core social network. In the past, LinkedIn has said that users visit its site most often to update their r sum s when they are looking for a new job. The company earns most of its revenue from subscriptions to its premium services and advertising on its site, generating $2.2 billion in sales last year. But the company has labored to become more than just an online repository for r sum s and job histories. For instance, in 2012, LinkedIn began soliciting influential business personalities like Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, to write original content for the site. The company hired Dan Roth, a former editor at Fortune magazine, to be LinkedIn s executive editor. Last year, the company introduced blogging capabilities for LinkedIn s users, essentially becoming an original content platform. And two years ago, the company bought Pulse, the maker of a newsreader app, for $90 million. LinkedIn binds all those services into what it calls the economic graph, where users can connect to both new professional opportunities and the skills needed to take advantage of them. But e-learning and professional development services is an entirely new category for the company, and LinkedIn hopes it will be another way it can lure users back to using its site every week or even every day. Lynda.com was started two decades ago as a small online portal for students to learn web design skills. It was founded by the husband-and-wife team of Lynda Weinman and Bruce Heavin, themselves graphic design experts who have both held positions at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. Today, Lynda.com focuses on a number of subjects, like management skills, programming and video. It sells subscriptions that start at $25 a month. The company collected more than $150 million in revenue last year and has turned a profit since 1997.
