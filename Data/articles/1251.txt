In India, Tiny Owl Founder Reportedly Detained for Two Days By Laid-Off Employees   and the Police: Well that was strange   and scary. Hours ago, one of six cofounders of Tiny Owl, a two-year-old, Mumbai, India-based food ordering software startup, was released after being held captive for two days by disgruntled former employees at the company s office in Pune. Tiny Owl had earlier this week announced $7.67 million in fresh funding from earlier backers Matrix Partners and Sequoia Capital. But the funding came with the understanding that Tiny Owl would follow through on a major restructuring to control its burn rate.As part of that restructuring plan, the company is shutting down its operations in four cities, including Pune. Which leads us to what happened to company cofounder Gaurav Choudhary. Choudhary had traveled to Pune earlier this week to oversee the office s closure, while his fellow cofounders   all of whom are graduates of IIT Bombay   traveled to sites in Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad to do the same. But according to various media accounts, soon after Choudhary informed Tiny Owl s Pune-based employees of the layoffs, he was asked to pay them immediately. When he said he couldn t, they reportedly refused to let him leave the building and return to Mumbai.
