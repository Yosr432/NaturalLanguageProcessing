Dating/hook-up app Tinder has staggering engagement levels, based on a simple psychological truth: looks matter: In the two years since Tinder was released, the smartphone app has exploded, processing more than a billion swipes left and right each day (right means you  like  someone, left means you don t) and matching more than 12 million people in that same time, the company said. Tinder s engagement is staggering. The company said that, on average, people log into the app 11 times a day. Women spend as much as 8.5 minutes swiping left and right during a single session; men spend 7.2 minutes. All of this can add up to 90 minutes each day. While conventional online dating sites have been around longer, they haven t come close to the popularity of Tinder.
