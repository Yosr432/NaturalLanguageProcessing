Pebble confirms it s shutting down, devs and software going to Fitbit: RIP Pebble  The wearable maker that pioneered wrist-based notifications before Apple and many others waded into the smartwatch space has confirmed it s closing its doors as an independent entity. Late last month rumors emerged that Fitbit was set to acquire Pebble   with our sources telling us the price-tag was between $34 million and $40M, a figure they said  barely  covered the startup s debts. Although the company avoided an explicit confirmation of the rumor by tweeting a shrug emoji until now. So really it sounds like it s only a matter of time before Pebble wrist-wear reaches the end of the functionality road   with whatever lifespan left now up to Fitbit to determine. Warranty support for Pebble devices has already been withdrawn, according to the blog post. While the Pebble 2, which only started shipping earlier this month, has now been canceled   with no more orders being accepted or fulfilled. Kickstarter backers whose rewards have not yet been fulfilled are slated to get a full refund within 4-8 weeks as a chargeback to their credit cards. Anyone who returned a Pebble device before December 7 will also get a refund, according to the post. In terms of what exactly Fitbit is acquiring, Migicovsky writes that  many  Pebble staff will be joining Fitbit to work on wearable software platforms. The focus of the acquisition looks firmly to be software.
