Facebook Hits 8 Billion Daily Video Views, Doubling From 4 Billion In April: Facebook video viewership is growing by leaps and bounds. It now sees 8 billion average daily video views from 500 million users. That s up from just 4 billion video views per day in April. Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement on the call to investors followingFacebook s blockbuster Q3 2015 earnings report. Some might contend that this stat isn t totally accurate since Facebook counts just 3 seconds of watching as a  view . But the 100% growth in seven months shows that even when controlling for this limitation of the metric, users are still voraciously consuming videos. Even at just 3 seconds per view, Facebook is generating 760 years of watch time each day. That means there s a ton of space for Facebook to lure in TV commercial dollars that are shifting to digital. It also has an opportunity to grow viewership further with an ongoing test where it pays a revenue share to top video creators.
