Snapchat is raising funds in an unusual manner - has raised $485M from >23 Investors since April 2014, valuation >$10B, 200M MAU:   [Snapchat] goes after individual investors at different valuations. It s a rolling investment and a rolling close. In theory you could say he s already done 40 rounds.  (40 is likely figurative rather than literal.) What this means is that, if it s true, then yes, Snapchat may have raised nearly $500 million in the last six months. Of that $500 million, it may be that only 75% of it is closed, and with portions at different valuations, some getting in pre-$10-billion, like Yahoo, and some above it and closer to $20 billion.The SEC filing notes that the date of first sale was in April 2014. We ve also heard that the current post money valuation is $20 billion, although others have disputed this and said it s closer to $10 billion. The cash is much-needed. One source said that Snapchat has an over $30 million-per-year burn rate, and pays half of that to Google Apps Engine to host all its photos, though this number seems low to us. Another noted that at one point the company was paying $3 million each month in legal fees alone. Snapchat s had its share of lawsuits. Monthly Active Users are now at 200M, up from 100M in August. Amazon was not one of the investors in this round
